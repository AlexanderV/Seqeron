# Wiki Log

Append-only chronological record of operations on the wiki. Each entry begins with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <description>` so it's parseable with `grep "^## \[" log.md | tail -N`.

Operations:
- `ingest` — a source was processed into the wiki.
- `query` — a question was answered against the wiki (typically only logged when the answer was filed back as synthesis).
- `lint` — a health check was run.
- `schema` — the schema was modified.
- `shard` — an index was sharded.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | README.md → readme (source) + 5 concepts + 1 gotcha
   Established hub pages from the project front page: three-front-doors, skill-layer,
   layered-architecture, scientific-rigor, validation-and-testing, research-grade-limitations.
   graph: +7 nodes, +4 typed edges

## [2026-07-09] ingest | ALGORITHMS_CHECKLIST_V2.md → algorithms-checklist-v2 (source) + 2 concepts
   Created test-unit-registry, definition-of-done. Updated validation-and-testing and
   research-grade-limitations (campaign-added pending re-validation, unverified complexity claims).
   graph: +3 nodes, +2 typed edges

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/ADVANCED_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md → advanced-testing-checklist (source)
   New source page (technique effectiveness/gap analysis, 10 techniques, P0–P3, 2026-03-19 baseline).
   Updated validation-and-testing (coverage-gap paragraph + typed edge). Flagged internal 79-vs-86
   unit discrepancy and that only architecture testing is complete. No new concepts (elaborates existing).
   graph: +1 node, +1 typed edge

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/MCP-Methods-Audit.md → mcp-methods-audit (source)
   New source page: 277 public static methods / 54 classes census of the C# API surface, with
   counting rules (overloads, extensions, SAM-flag one-liners, StatisticsHelper). Updated
   three-front-doors (quantified the C# API door). Flagged 277-methods-vs-427-MCP-tools and
   54-vs-57-class-denominator discrepancies as data points, not contradictions.
   graph: no typed edges (flat inventory; mentions auto-derived); +1 node

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/mcp-checklist.md → mcp-checklist (source)
   New source page for the MCP Implementation Checklist v4. Flagged prominently as SUPERSEDED
   (2026-07-01): a 12-server/241-tool plan never built; live status is docs/mcp/MCP_STATUS.md (11
   real servers). Captured DoD gates, 1000-5999 error catalog, two-tests-per-tool (Schema+Binding,
   no business asserts), MethodId/HasDocs/DocRef traceability, G1-G5 gates, and the SuffixTree.Mcp→
   Seqeron.Mcp rename. Added 241-vs-277-vs-427 tool-count reconciliation; cross-linked from
   mcp-methods-audit. No typed edges (supersession target docs/mcp/MCP_STATUS.md is not yet a wiki
   node; mentions auto-derived).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/mcp-plan.md → mcp-plan (source)
   New source page for the MCP Implementation Plan v4 — the sibling *design doc* to mcp-checklist.
   Flagged SUPERSEDED (2026-07-01): 12-server/241-tool design never built (real: 11 servers/427
   tools, docs/mcp/MCP_STATUS.md). Distinctive content vs the checklist: v3→v4 context-budget
   rationale (5-7%/24%/2-8%), full 241-tool inventory across all 12 servers, and sections 6-8
   standards the banner declares still-valid (naming, JSON-Schema 2020-12, error ranges 1000-5999,
   SemVer, 2-tests-per-tool, .mcp.json+.md doc contract). Reused the 241/277/427 reconciliation.
   Cross-linked bidirectionally with mcp-checklist. No typed edges (superseded near-sibling source;
   ontology has no fitting source→source predicate, and count deltas are reconciled not contradictory;
   mentions auto-derived).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/mcp-prompt.md → mcp-prompt (source)
   New source page for the CURRENT one-tool-per-session MCP-completion subagent prompt (the live
   successor to the superseded mcp-plan/mcp-checklist). Captured: docs/mcp/MCP_STATUS.md as authoritative
   B/T/D ledger; the shipped 11-server decomposition named concretely (server→project→tools file) —
   first source to enumerate it (no Variants/Assembly/Epigenetics/Structure servers; Analysis+Annotation+
   MolTools consolidate them; Core still under SuffixTree.Mcp.Core); Sequence/Parsers/Core gold standard;
   the 3-part tool-wrapper DoD (binding attribute+record return, ≥2 NUnit tests, .mcp.json+.md docs);
   execution flow + full-green-gate + stale-bin/obj caveat. FLAGGED CONTRADICTION: the prompt's DoD
   requires evidence-based Binding tests asserting exact documented values, reversing the
   no-business-asserts policy in mcp-checklist/mcp-plan (annotated both pages surgically). Cross-linked
   both ways with mcp-checklist and mcp-plan.
   graph: +1 node, +2 typed edges (contradicts → mcp-checklist, mcp-plan)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/sonar-gate-plan.md → sonar-gate-plan (source) + 1 concept
   New source page for the Sonar gate ratchet tracker (66/66 SonarAnalyzer rules → blocking or
   silenced-with-justification; green under TreatWarningsAsErrors; 14 assemblies / 20,266 core
   tests). Created the build-quality-gate concept (static-analysis gate + warnings-as-errors,
   fix-vs-silence ratchet, review-not-blind-fix on S1244/S125). Linked it from validation-and-testing
   (added docs/sonar-gate-plan.md to that page's sources). Flagged the doc's internal staleness: a
   "remaining 31 rules" planning section survives alongside the 66/66 completion banner (Log rows are
   ground truth). Captured the S4456 fail-fast behaviour change and the pre-existing flaky FsCheck
   properties.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (build-quality-gate relates_to validation-and-testing)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ALIGN-GLOBAL-001-Evidence.md → align-global-001-evidence (source) + 2 concepts
   First per-algorithm Evidence file (of ~213). Created the shared hub concept
   algorithm-validation-evidence (templated 5-part structure: header/online-sources/dataset/
   deviations/references) so future evidence ingests link in rather than duplicate. Created the
   genuinely-distinct algorithm concept global-alignment-needleman-wunsch (linear-gap recurrence,
   O(nm), traceback, GapExtend=d / GapOpen-unused, affine-as-extension). Concise source page for
   the ALIGN-GLOBAL-001 artifact (Wikipedia sources, GCATGCG/GATTACA example, score 0). Linked
   the evidence hub from test-unit-registry. No contradictions; deviations = None.
   graph: +3 nodes, +3 typed edges

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ALIGN-MULTI-001-Evidence.md → align-multi-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Second per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   multiple-sequence-alignment (star `MultipleAlign`, iterative-refinement `MultipleAlignIterative`
   = MUSCLE Stage 3, consistency `MultipleAlignConsistency` = T-Coffee; SP-score objective, majority
   consensus, invariants, NP-completeness). Concise source page capturing the unusually rich file
   (main doc + MUSCLE and T-Coffee addenda, 2026-06-23) and its design-choice deviations (cosine-
   similarity center pick, gap-gap=0, gap-votes/tie-to-nucleotide consensus, UPGMA vs NJ, gap-0
   progressive DP). Linked the new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and
   added the ALIGN-MULTI source to that hub's frontmatter. No contradictions; all deviations flagged
   as API/structure choices preserving the verified properties.
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, alternative_to global-alignment-needleman-wunsch)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ALIGN-SEMI-001-Evidence.md → align-semi-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Third per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   semi-global-alignment-fitting (ends-free "glocal" hybrid; fitting/query-in-reference variant
   = Rosalind SIMS; NW recurrence with no zero floor, first row = 0 free reference start gaps,
   first column = d·i, traceback from max of last row; overlap/OAP and full-semiglobal/SMGB
   noted as sibling variants; INV-1..5). Concise source page for the ALIGN-SEMI-001 artifact
   (Wikipedia + Rosalind SIMS/SMGB + Brudno 2003 glocal sources, corner cases, fitting-variant
   design choice). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and
   added ALIGN-SEMI to that hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal nav link from
   global-alignment-needleman-wunsch. No contradictions; deviation = deliberate fitting-variant
   selection + standard .NET null contract.
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, alternative_to global-alignment-needleman-wunsch)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ALIGN-STATS-001-Evidence.md → align-stats-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fourth per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   alignment-statistics (post-alignment metric layer, not an aligner): percent
   identity/similarity/gaps under the EMBOSS/BLAST convention (count / Length × 100,
   denominator includes gap columns; Similarity = identical OR positively-scoring columns, so
   Similarity ≥ Identity; "positive substitution score ⇒ similar"); DNA SimpleDna ⇒ Similarity
   = Identity vs Mismatch=+1 ⇒ Similarity > Identity; srspair three-line markup (|/:/space, the
   graded `.` tier unreachable → rendering-only). Concise source page for the ALIGN-STATS-001
   artifact (EMBOSS needle/AlignFormats + BLAST NBK1734 + pseqsid sources, the 149-column
   HBA/HBB worked example as a formula cross-check, two hand-built DNA datasets, empty/null/
   lineWidth contracts). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   and added ALIGN-STATS to that hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal nav link from
   global-alignment-needleman-wunsch. No contradictions; only deviation is the rendering-only
   `.`-tier collapse, non-correctness-affecting.
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, relates_to global-alignment-needleman-wunsch)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ANNOT-CODING-001-Evidence.md → annot-coding-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fifth per-algorithm Evidence file and the first from the annotation domain. Created the
   genuinely-distinct concept coding-potential-hexamer-score (CPAT hexamer usage-bias coding
   potential, Wang et al. 2013): score = mean of ln(coding[k]/noncoding[k]) over in-frame
   hexamers (wordSize 6, stepSize 3, natural log, codon-boundary words via word_generator);
   sign convention positive=coding / negative=noncoding; pseudo-score branches (coding-only
   +1, noncoding-only -1), both-zero-in-both hexamer skipped-not-counted (verified verbatim
   vs canonical liguowang/cpat + WGLab/lncScore 2026-06-15), short-seq and missing-key skips;
   unit-agnostic tables (counts vs proportions differ by additive constant). Concise source
   page for the ANNOT-CODING-001 artifact (CPAT paper + FrameKmer.py + EMBOSS tcode/Fickett
   sources, worked example 0.34657359027997264, two assumption records). Linked new source +
   concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ANNOT-CODING to that hub's
   frontmatter. Contradictions: none between sources; only deviation is the C# port's -1->0
   no-scorable-hexamer sentinel (affects meaningless empty scores only). Follow-up: Fickett
   TESTCODE recorded as a related not-implemented alternative if it is ever ingested.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ANNOT-CODONUSAGE-001-Evidence.md → annot-codonusage-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Sixth per-algorithm Evidence file; first of the large codon-usage family (CODON-CAI/ENC/OPT/
   RARE/RSCU/STATS/USAGE, SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON still to come). Created the
   genuinely-distinct concept relative-synonymous-codon-usage (RSCU, Sharp & Li 1986): per-codon
   codon-usage-bias normalization RSCU = n_i·x_{i,j}/Σx over a synonymous family; 1.0=no bias,
   >1 preferred / <1 under-represented, bounded [0,n_i], Σ-over-family=n_i invariant; counts
   pooled across all reference sequences, sense codons only (forward_table), single-codon Met/Trp
   always 1.0, unobserved family → 0.0; Standard NCBI table 1 default. Deliberately positioned as
   the base anchor of the codon family so future codon ingests link in; distinguished from CAI's
   0.5 pseudocount (Sharp & Li 1987, CAI-only, NOT applied to plain RSCU). Concise source page for
   the ANNOT-CODONUSAGE-001 artifact (LIRMM formula page + PMC2528880 + Sharp & Li 1986 primary +
   CodonU internal_comp.py::rscu + NCBI table 1 sources; Leu CTTCTTCTGTTA → 3/1.5/1.5/0/0/0,
   uniform Phe → 1.0, Met → 1.0 datasets; two API-default assumptions). Linked new source + concept
   into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ANNOT-CODONUSAGE to that hub's frontmatter.
   Contradictions: none — LIRMM formula, PMC2528880 definition, and CodonU code are algebraically
   identical. Follow-up: when CODON-RSCU-001 (an apparent RSCU duplicate) and the rest of the codon
   family are ingested, share this concept rather than duplicating; CAI/ENC/etc. may each warrant
   their own concept.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ANNOT-REPEAT-001-Evidence.md → annot-repeat-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Seventh per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   repetitive-element-detection, deliberately scoped as the shared anchor for the whole
   repeats/tandem family (GENOMIC-REPEAT, GENOMIC-TANDEM, microsatellite/STR, low-complexity)
   so future repeat ingests link in rather than re-deriving definitions. Covers the three
   sub-problems: tandem repeats (head-to-tail, ≥2 copies, STR 1-6bp / minisatellite 10-60bp,
   primitive-shortest-period rule), inverted repeats (IUPACpal grammar W W̄ᴿ / W G W̄ᴿ, imperfect
   δ_H ≤ k, zero-gap = even-length palindrome), and RepeatMasker-class assignment (SINE/LINE/LTR/
   DNA/Satellite/Simple_repeat/Low_complexity/Small RNA/Unknown). Concise source page for the
   ANNOT-REPEAT-001 artifact (Wikipedia Tandem/Inverted + IUPACpal Hampson 2021 PMC7866733 +
   RepeatMasker sources; ATTCGATTCGATTCG/GAATTC/TTACGAAAAAACGTAA datasets; six MUST tests).
   Captured the one assumption: ClassifyRepeat matches by exact-substring containment (element ⊆
   query, longest match, one-directional) with motif-size Simple_repeat fallback, NOT Smith-
   Waterman-Gotoh homology against a curated Repbase library — a Framework/Simplified limitation,
   vocabulary source-backed. Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   and added ANNOT-REPEAT to that hub's frontmatter. Contradictions: none (Wikipedia & IUPACpal IR
   definitions are the same grammar; RepeatMasker class list is shared vocabulary). Follow-up: when
   GENOMIC-REPEAT/GENOMIC-TANDEM and other repeat-family units are ingested, share
   repetitive-element-detection rather than duplicating.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-CONSENSUS-001-Evidence.md → assembly-consensus-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Eighth per-algorithm Evidence file; first of the large Assembly family (DBG/OLC/SCAFFOLD/COVER/
   STATS/TRIM/CONSENSUS/CORRECT/MERGE still to come). Rejected a broad "genome-assembly" hub as too
   vague/heterogeneous for a useful anchor; instead created the genuinely-distinct concept
   consensus-sequence (column-wise majority/threshold consensus — the C of Overlap-Layout-Consensus
   and the same operation as the MSA consensus step). Decision rule traced verbatim to Biopython
   dumb_consensus: tally non-gap residues only, emit iff unique max AND max_size/num_atoms >= threshold
   (strict >=) else ambiguous; tie→ambiguous (not arbitrary pick); all-gap column→ambiguous with no
   div-by-zero (short-circuit and); consensus length = longest read (ragged handled). EMBOSS cons
   plurality + Wikipedia definition/IUPAC corroborate. Two parameterized presentation-only default
   assumptions: ambiguous symbol N-not-X (DNA/RNA IUPAC), default threshold 0.5-not-Biopython-0.7
   (simple-majority); neither alters the source-backed rule. Concise source page for the artifact
   (three sources, four datasets, nine MUST tests). Linked new source + concept into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-CONSENSUS to that hub's frontmatter.
   Contradictions: none. Follow-up: future Assembly-family and MSA-consensus units share
   consensus-sequence rather than duplicating; graph/OLC/scaffold units likely warrant their own
   distinct concepts.
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, relates_to multiple-sequence-alignment)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-CORRECT-001-Evidence.md → assembly-correct-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Ninth per-algorithm Evidence file; second of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS). Created the
   genuinely-distinct concept kmer-spectrum-error-correction — the anchor for the assembly CORRECT
   family (distinct from consensus-sequence). Two-sided k-mer-spectrum read error correction traced
   verbatim to Musket (Liu 2013) + Quake (Kelley 2010): trusted k-mer = multiplicity > coverage
   cut-off, base trusted if covered by any trusted k-mer; find the unique alternative base making
   ALL k-mers covering position i trusted (evaluate leftmost AND rightmost covering k-mer), ≤1
   substitution per k-mer; >1 valid alternative → unchanged (ambiguity), no correcting set →
   unchanged; substitution-only so read count + per-read length preserved. Song & Florea 2018
   corroborate (solid/weak k-mers). Concise source page for the artifact (three rank-1 sources, the
   k=3/cut-off=2 single-substitution ACGTACGT worked example, the k=1 ambiguity example, six MUST
   tests). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added
   ASSEMBLY-CORRECT to that hub's frontmatter. One assumption: kmerSize=15/minKmerFrequency=2 fixed
   defaults (vs reference auto-cut-off-from-histogram-valley) are non-behavioral — every behavioral
   test passes k and cut-off explicitly. Contradictions: none (all three sources describe the same
   trusted/untrusted two-sided model). Follow-up: remaining Assembly-family units (DBG/OLC/SCAFFOLD/
   COVER/STATS/TRIM/MERGE) likely warrant their own distinct concepts.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-COVER-001-Evidence.md → assembly-cover-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Tenth per-algorithm Evidence file; third of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT).
   Created the genuinely-distinct concept coverage-depth-calculation — the anchor for the assembly
   COVER family. Per-base sequencing depth = count of placed reads spanning each reference position
   (exact, model-free); average depth = Σdepth/G = Lander-Waterman C=LN/G; breadth = (#depth≥1)/G =
   1−e^−c. Boundary-clip at reference end + all-zero/empty-input rules; hand-built ACGTTGCAAT oracle
   (depth [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1], avg 1.5, breadth 1.0); Lander-Waterman Poisson (P(uncovered)=e^−c,
   1×→0.37, 5×→0.0067) captured explicitly as a property/derivation check only — the per-base array
   is exact regardless of uniformity. Concise source page for the artifact (Illumina rank-2 + Daniel
   Cook + Metagenomics Wiki rank-3 + Daley PMC7398442 rank-1 + Lander-Waterman 1988 primary sources,
   two datasets, seven MUST/SHOULD/COULD tests). Linked new source + concept into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-COVER to that hub's frontmatter. One
   assumption: read-placement model (ungapped minOverlap best-match FindBestAlignment) is
   implementation-level and out of scope — tests use unambiguous exact-match reads to isolate the
   source-defined counting rule. Contradictions: none (all sources give the same depth/average/breadth
   definitions). Follow-up: remaining Assembly-family units (DBG/OLC/SCAFFOLD/STATS/TRIM/MERGE) likely
   warrant their own distinct concepts.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-DBG-001-Evidence.md → assembly-dbg-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Eleventh per-algorithm Evidence file; fourth of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT,
   COVER). Created the genuinely-distinct concept de-bruijn-graph-assembly — the anchor for the
   assembly DBG family (BuildDeBruijnGraph + AssembleDeBruijn). Graph construction traced verbatim to
   Langmead's JHU DBG notes: distinct (k-1)-mers are nodes, each k-mer is one directed prefix→suffix
   edge, repeated k-mers make a directed multigraph; chop bound range(0,len-(k-1)) ⇒ reads < k yield
   no k-mers. Reconstruction as an Eulerian walk under Jones & Pevzner Theorems 8.1 (cycle iff all
   balanced) / 8.2 (path iff ≤2 semi-balanced), O(|E|) Hierholzer, spelled as path[0] + last char of
   each subsequent node; Compeau-Pevzner-Tesler 2011 supply the assembly application (Eulerian-path
   tractable vs NP-complete Hamiltonian/overlap). Unique-walk oracles (AAABBBA k=3 with full node/edge
   set, a_long_long_long_time k=5, to_every… k=4-correct/k=3-wrong turn-repeat, ATGGCGTGCA k=4) plus
   the AAABBBBA multiedge case; failure modes (repeat≥k-1 → multiple walks, gap → disconnected/multi-
   contig, extra copy/error → non-Eulerian, Superwalk NP-hard). Concise source page for the artifact.
   Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-DBG to
   that hub's frontmatter. Three assumptions: walk-selection unspecified (exact asserts on unique-walk
   inputs only; non-unique checked on invariants/branch structure), empty/null → empty AssemblyResult
   (mirrors OLC), reads < k contribute no k-mers. Contradictions: none — Langmead cites the same J&P
   Euler theorems Compeau builds on; Compeau 2011 PDFs are image-only so cited for metadata only.
   Follow-up: OLC (the alternative fragment-assembly formulation) warrants its own concept when
   ingested; remaining Assembly units (SCAFFOLD/STATS/TRIM/MERGE) likely warrant distinct concepts.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to test-unit-registry)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-MERGE-001-Evidence.md → assembly-merge-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twelfth per-algorithm Evidence file; fifth of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT,
   COVER, DBG). Created the genuinely-distinct concept contig-merge-overlap-collapse — the anchor
   for the assembly MERGE family: the suffix–prefix overlap collapse primitive
   MergeContigs(contig1, contig2, overlapLength) behind greedy shortest-common-superstring and the
   OLC layout step. Overlap traced verbatim to Langmead's JHU SCS/OLC notes + MIT 7.91J Lecture 6:
   overlap = length-l suffix of X exactly matching a length-l prefix of Y (l ≤ min(|X|,|Y|)),
   suffixPrefixMatch returns the longest such match else 0, collapse keeps one copy so
   |merge| = |c1|+|c2|−l; overlap 0 → plain concatenation X+Y. Published oracles BAA+AAB(ov2)→BAAB,
   {AAA,AAB,ABB,BBB,BBA} chain→AAABBBA (len 7), BAA+AAB(ov0)→BAAAAB. Two API-contract assumptions
   (caller-supplied overlap length trusted not re-verified — verification is FindOverlap's job;
   out-of-range overlap ≤0 or >min → concatenation), both derived directly from the source facts,
   neither a correctness/scoring parameter. Concise source page for the artifact (Langmead SCS +
   Langmead OLC + MIT 7.91J rank-1 sources, Compeau 2011 background-only, three oracles, MUST/SHOULD/
   COULD tests). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added
   ASSEMBLY-MERGE to that hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal nav link from de-bruijn-graph-assembly
   (MERGE is the overlap-based sibling of the DBG k-mer/Eulerian formulation). Contradictions: none —
   the three sources give the identical suffix-of-X/prefix-of-Y overlap definition and corroborate one
   another. Follow-up: an end-to-end OLC concept (and remaining Assembly units SCAFFOLD/STATS/TRIM)
   warrant their own pages when ingested; FindOverlap/FindAllOverlaps (the overlap-discovery side)
   would share contig-merge-overlap-collapse.
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, relates_to de-bruijn-graph-assembly)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-OLC-001-Evidence.md → assembly-olc-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; sixth of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT,
   COVER, DBG, MERGE). Created the genuinely-distinct concept overlap-layout-consensus-assembly —
   the anchor for the assembly OLC family and the second of the two canonical fragment-assembly
   paradigms (FindAllOverlaps + AssembleOLC). Three stages traced verbatim to Compeau, Pevzner &
   Tesler 2011 + Langmead OLC/SCS notes: Overlap (read=node overlap graph, directed edge A→B on the
   longest suffix-of-A/prefix-of-B ≥ threshold, report only longest per pair), Layout (exact = a
   Hamiltonian path = NP-complete → heuristic transitive reduction + non-branching-stretch contigs),
   Consensus (majority vote per column). Complexity suffix-tree O(N+a) vs all-pairs DP O(N²).
   Published oracles: GTACGTACGAT 6-mers minOverlap4 → exactly 12 directed edges (lengths 4/5,
   re-derived), 5-overlap tiling → single AAAAACCCCCGGGGGTTTTT, CTCTAGGCC/TAGGCCCTC l=3 → overlap 6.
   Failure modes: NP-complete layout, repeats>read-length split contigs, error dead-end subgraphs,
   greedy-SCS suboptimal, sub-resolution repeats collapse. Two assumptions: exact-match identity 1.0
   for canonical numeric cases (minIdentity generalizes; separate threshold test 0.875 accepted@0.85/
   rejected@0.95), empty read set → empty AssemblyResult. Concise source page for the artifact. Linked
   new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-OLC to that hub's
   frontmatter; added reciprocal nav links from de-bruijn-graph-assembly (fulfilling its flagged OLC
   follow-up) and contig-merge-overlap-collapse. Modeled OLC as alternative_to de-bruijn-graph-assembly
   (Hamiltonian/overlap-graph vs Eulerian/k-mer, the contrast Compeau 2011 draws explicitly).
   Contradictions: none — Compeau 2011 and both Langmead notes give the identical overlap-graph/

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-SCAFFOLD-001-Evidence.md → assembly-scaffold-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fourteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; seventh of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT,
   COVER, DBG, MERGE, OLC). Created the genuinely-distinct concept scaffolding — the anchor for the
   assembly SCAFFOLD family, deliberately positioned as a *downstream* step orthogonal to the
   overlap-vs-k-mer DBG/OLC contrast (it lays finished ordered contigs onto a coordinate frame with
   sized gaps rather than reconstructing sequence). Construction rule traced verbatim to Jackman et
   al. ABySS 2.0 (Genome Research 2017): scaffold = ordered path contigs concatenated interspersed
   with runs of `N` whose length = the (upstream ML-estimated) inter-contig distance; positive gap
   g → exactly g fill chars, scaffold length = Σ|contig|+Σgap; each contig in ≤1 scaffold, unlinked →
   singleton; fill char parameterized (source fixes default `N`). Non-positive (zero/negative) gap →
   AGP unknown-size default 100 N: NCBI AGP v2.1 ("gap lengths must be positive ... use U and 100
   ... GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ standard for unknown-size gaps") supplies the source-backed 100 constant,
   Sahlin et al. 2012 confirm the negative-gap case is frequent (de Bruijn one-k-mer overlap), ABySS
   says negative = overlap → merge if found. Oracles ACGTNNNTTGGNNCCAA (len 17, 1 scaffold) and
   AAAA+100N+TTTT (len 108). One assumption, a scoping decision not an invented value: unresolved-
   overlap placeholder falls back to the AGP unknown-gap length 100 (this unit does no overlap
   resolution) — the 100 is source-backed, only the fall-back-rather-than-resolve choice is assumed.
   Concise source page for the artifact (ABySS 2.0 + AGP v2.1 + Sahlin 2012 + Bambus sources, two
   oracles, MUST/SHOULD/COULD coverage). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-
   evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-SCAFFOLD to that hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal nav link
   from contig-merge-overlap-collapse (scaffolding hands off to the suffix–prefix merge primitive on
   the negative-gap = overlap case). Contradictions: none — ABySS/AGP/Sahlin/Bambus give the same
   ordered-contigs + sized-`N`-gap model; the AGP 100-N default and the ABySS negative-gap=overlap
   rule are complementary. Follow-up: remaining Assembly units (STATS/TRIM) warrant their own pages;
   an overlap-resolving scaffolder (if ever built) would compose scaffolding with contig-merge.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-STATS-001-Evidence.md → assembly-stats-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fifteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; eighth of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS, CORRECT,
   COVER, DBG, MERGE, OLC, SCAFFOLD). Created the genuinely-distinct concept assembly-statistics —
   the anchor for the assembly STATS family: the read-only contiguity/QC summary metrics over a set
   of contig lengths (N50/L50/Nx/Lx/N90/L90/auN + totals/largest/smallest/GC/N-run gaps), downstream
   of and orthogonal to the DBG/OLC/merge build steps and the scaffolding layout step. Definitions
   traced verbatim to Miller, Koren & Sutton 2010 (N50 = smallest of the fewest largest contigs whose
   combined length is "at least 50%") + Wikipedia worked examples + QUAST `N50.py` (`NG50_and_LG50`
   stop test `s <= limit` = inclusive cumulative ≥ threshold; `au_metric` = ΣL²/ΣL) + Heng Li 2020
   (Nx covers x%, auN = area under Nx curve = ΣLᵢ²/ΣLⱼ). Nx is a length, Lx a count; N90 ≤ N50 /
   L90 ≥ L50 monotonicity; boundary inclusive (≥). Published oracles: Assembly A {80,70,50,40,30,20}
   total 290 → N50 70/L50 2/N90 30/L90 5/auN≈57.586, Assembly B (+10,+5) total 305 → N50 50/L50 3,
   auN check {100,80,60,40,20} → 22000/300 = 73.333…/N50 80/L50 2. Two assumptions outside the cited
   contract: empty input → all-zero AssemblyStatistics (QUAST returns None) — an API-shape choice
   changing no defined value (§6.1); and CalculateStatistics.MedianLength reports the upper median
   (lengths[count/2]), an auxiliary field the N50 literature doesn't define, tested-as-implemented and
   flagged not-source-derived. Concise source page for the artifact (Miller 2010 rank-1 + Wikipedia
   rank-4 + QUAST rank-3 + Heng Li rank-3 sources, three datasets, MUST/SHOULD/COULD coverage). Linked
   new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added ASSEMBLY-STATS to that
   hub's frontmatter. Contradictions: none — Miller/Wikipedia/QUAST/Heng Li give identical
   largest-first inclusive-≥ definitions and QUAST au_metric matches Heng Li's ΣL²/ΣL exactly.
   Follow-up: remaining Assembly unit (TRIM) warrants its own page when ingested.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ASSEMBLY-TRIM-001-Evidence.md → assembly-trim-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Sixteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; ninth and last of the Assembly family (after CONSENSUS,
   CORRECT, COVER, DBG, MERGE, OLC, SCAFFOLD, STATS). Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   quality-trimming-running-sum — the anchor for the assembly TRIM family, deliberately positioned as
   a read-QC *preprocessing* step (operates on one read's Phred quality string, reconstructs no
   sequence) upstream of error-correction and the DBG/OLC build steps. Running-sum core traced
   verbatim to cutadapt algorithm docs (which state the algorithm "is the same as the one used by
   BWA"): subtract the cutoff from every quality, compute partial sums from each index to the 3' end,
   cut at the argmin; "repeat for the other end" on the 5' pass. BWA `bwa_trim_read` (bwaseqio.c, Heng
   Li) gives the algebraically-equivalent argmax form (accumulate threshold−(q−33) from the 3' end,
   track argmax max_l) plus two BWA-specifics: `s<0` early break and the `BWA_MIN_RDLEN=35` hard floor
   (bwtaln.h). Phred+33 decode `q = ASCII−33` from Cock et al. 2010 (NAR, rank 1). Published oracle:
   qualities 42,40,26,27,8,7,11,4,2,3 (`KI;<)(,%#$`) @ threshold 10 → partial sums min −25 at index 4
   → first 4 bases kept (with full ASCII derivation). Failure modes: threshold<1 disables (BWA guard /
   cutoff 0 → nothing trimmed), all-high unchanged, all-low fully removed, good-base-among-bad retained
   only if no new minimum reached (cutadapt "refinement"). Two assumptions, both outside the running-sum
   optimum: both-end pass order (3'-then-5' on the surviving window — not numerically significant since
   passes act on disjoint ends), and the `minLength` post-trim filter (cutadapt `--minimum-length`,
   drops trimmed length < minLength — a documented downstream filter, not the core). Concise source page
   for the artifact. Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added
   ASSEMBLY-TRIM to that hub's frontmatter. Contradictions: none — cutadapt explicitly identifies its
   algorithm with BWA's; the BWA argmax of accumulated (threshold−q) is the argmin of cutadapt's partial
   sums of (q−threshold); Cock supplies the shared Phred+33 encoding. Follow-up: the Assembly family is
   now fully ingested (9/9); FASTQ-quality-parsing units, if ingested, would relate to this concept.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CHROM-ANEU-001-Evidence.md → chrom-aneu-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Seventeenth per-algorithm Evidence file; first of the Chromosome-analysis family. Created the
   genuinely-distinct concept aneuploidy-detection — the anchor for the chromosome copy-number/ploidy
   family (karyotype/centromere/arm-ratio/synteny units will get their own concepts). Two-stage
   algorithm: per-bin copy number from read depth (logRatio = log2(observedDepth/medianDepth), CN =
   round(2^logRatio × 2) clamped [0,10], ×2 rescales the ratio onto the diploid baseline so ratio
   1.0 → CN 2) then whole-chromosome classification requiring a dominant CN across ≥ minFraction
   (default 80%) of bins, returning only CN ≠ 2 (nullisomy/monosomy/trisomy/tetrasomy/pentasomy/
   "Copy number = N"); the ≥80% gate is also the mosaicism tolerance. Confidence = 1 − min(1,
   |expected − observed|) with expected = CN/2, observed = 2^logRatio; = 1.0 at every integer-CN
   ratio (S1 boundary test 0.0/0.5/1.0/1.5/2.0). Concise source page for the artifact (Wikipedia
   Aneuploidy + CNV + Griffiths 2000 + Santaguida-Amon 2015 + McCarroll-Altshuler 2007 sources;
   Down/Edwards/Patau/Turner/Klinefelter clinical oracles). Linked new source + concept into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added CHROM-ANEU to that hub's frontmatter. Two documented
   limitations (artifact §7): sex chromosomes not special-cased (X/Y scored vs CN=2 baseline, normal
   male single-X would flag monosomic — research-grade simplification, autosome-focused) and partial
   aneuploidy detected per-bin but not whole-chromosome (needs consistent CN ≥80% bins). Contradictions:
   none — Wikipedia supplies the definition + CN terminology ladder, the depth→CN model and confidence
   formula are implementation definitions the sources don't contradict. Follow-up: remaining
   Chromosome-analysis units (karyotype, centromere/telomere, arm-ratio, synteny, GC-skew) warrant their
   own concepts when ingested.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CHROM-CENT-001-Evidence.md → chrom-cent-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Eighteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; second of the Chromosome-analysis family (after ANEU).
   Created the genuinely-distinct concept centromere-analysis — the anchor for the chromosome
   centromere / alpha-satellite family, sibling of aneuploidy-detection. Unusually this artifact is a
   layered multi-session record: base `AnalyzeCentromere` (generic tandem-repeat-density heuristic,
   sliding-window k-mer + low GC-variability + k=15 repeat content; AlphaSatelliteContent is a repeat
   score NOT alpha-satellite-specific) + Levan 1964 q/p arm-ratio classification (exact thresholds
   1.7/3.0/7.0/∞ → Metacentric/Submetacentric/Subtelocentric/Acrocentric/Telocentric) + four opt-in
   additive detectors: DetectAlphaSatellite/FindCenpBBoxes (171-bp tandem period ±5, ≥0.50
   self-similarity, AT>0.50, 17-bp CENP-B box IUPAC `YTTCGTTGGAARCGGGA` — no embedded monomer string),
   DetectHigherOrderRepeat (split into 171-bp monomers, GlobalAlign+CalculateStatistics, HOR period =
   smallest k with monomers k apart ≥95% identical / <5% divergence across ≥90% of array; intra-HOR
   50–70% vs inter-HOR 97–100%; period 1 = homogeneous 1-mer not multi-monomer HOR), and
   AssignSuprachromosomalFamily (bundled CC0 Dfam ALR/ALRa=A, ALRb=B via CENP-B box; ≥60% gate; SF3
   pentameric period%5==0 / SF4 monomeric A-type / {SF1,SF2} dimeric A→B / SF5 irregular). Sources:

   Shepelev 2009 + Dfam (CC0) + T2T/CHM13 (CC0). Concise source page for the artifact. Linked new
   source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added CHROM-CENT to that hub's
   frontmatter; added a reciprocal sibling nav link from aneuploidy-detection. Two flagged ASSUMPTION
   parameters (≥60% alpha-satellite gate, SF3⇔period%5==0 pentameric proxy). Contradictions: none — the
   encyclopedic + alphoid-DNA literature + Dfam/T2T reference agree (171-bp monomer, 17-bp box, <5%
   inter-HOR recur). Residual data-blocked limitation: SF1-vs-SF2 not separated and diverged-pentamer
   SF3 (e.g. DXZ1 period 12) not tagged — needs an SF-resolved consensus monomer library that is
   non-redistributable (no LICENSE / non-machine-retrievable supplements). Follow-up: remaining
   Chromosome-analysis units (telomere, arm-ratio, synteny, GC-skew) warrant their own concepts.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CHROM-TELO-001-Evidence.md → chrom-telo-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twenty-first per-algorithm Evidence file; fifth of the Chromosome-analysis family (after ANEU, CENT,
   KARYO, SYNT). Created the genuinely-distinct concept telomere-analysis — the anchor for the chromosome
   telomere family, sibling of aneuploidy-detection. Two parts: repeat detection at each end (3′ forward
   TTAGGG / 5′ reverse-complement CCCTAA, 6-bp vertebrate unit) with a configurable 70%-per-window purity
   threshold (5/6 match for 6-bp, 5/7 for Arabidopsis TTTAGGG; divergent TTAGGA → purity 5/6≈0.833),
   purity∈[0,1] tracked with length; and length estimation direct from the run or via the qPCR T/S ratio
   (Cawthon 2002 linearity EstimatedLength=referenceLength×(tsRatio/referenceRatio)). Invariants: length≥0,
   purity∈[0,1], threshold consistency (has⇒len≥minTelomereLength), IsCriticallyShort=(hasTelomere&&
   len<criticalLength)OR empty, orientation (5′=revcomp / 3′=forward). Four configurable parameters flagged
   as implementation defaults NOT biological constants: criticalLength 3000, minTelomereLength 500,
   searchLength (truncates reported length), referenceLength 7000. Sources: Wikipedia Telomere + Meyne 1989
   (TTAGGG conserved across vertebrates, PMID 2780561) + Cawthon 2002 (T/S ∝ length, r²=0.677, PMID

   for the artifact. Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added
   CHROM-TELO to that hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal sibling nav link from aneuploidy-detection.
   Contradictions: none — Deviations and Assumptions is None; Wikipedia repeat table, Meyne 1989 repeat
   conservation, and Cawthon 2002 T/S proportionality agree. Follow-up: remaining Chromosome-analysis units
   (arm-ratio, GC-skew) warrant their own concepts; non-vertebrate telomere repeats (documented in the

   Nineteenth per-algorithm Evidence file; third of the Chromosome-analysis family (after ANEU, CENT).
   Created the genuinely-distinct concept karyotype-analysis — the anchor for the chromosome
   karyotyping / ploidy-detection family, sibling of aneuploidy-detection and centromere-analysis. Two
   independent algorithms: `AnalyzeKaryotype` karyotypes chromosome *descriptors* (split sex/autosome,
   group autosomes by base name, count copies, compare to expected ploidy, label nullisomy..pentasomy
   by absolute copy count — same cytogenetic ladder as ANEU but keyed on descriptor counts not depth
   log-ratios; TotalChromosomes/TotalGenomeSize/MeanChromosomeLength invariants); and `DetectPloidy`
   estimates whole-genome ploidy from read depth (true median of sorted depths, ratio=medianDepth/
   expectedDiploidDepth, ploidy=round(ratio×2) clamped [1,8] — note the [1,8] whole-genome clamp and
   direct ratio vs ANEU's [0,10] CN clamp via 2^logRatio; confidence=1−|ratio×2−ploidy|×2, empty→(2,0)).
   Sources all Wikipedia (Karyotype/Ploidy/Aneuploidy, verified 2026-03-08). Oracles: normal diploid
   human 46/no-aneuploidy, Down (3×chr21→Trisomy), Turner (45,X→Monosomy), disomy-in-tetraploid,

   empty-karyotype, DD2 empty-depth→(2,0), DD3 [1,8] clamp, DD4 nullisomy unreachable via GroupBy —
   absent chromosomes form no group, term mapped for completeness only, DD5 disomy is aneuploidy only
   in non-diploid/ISCN contexts). Concise source page for the artifact. Linked new source + concept
   into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added CHROM-KARYO to that hub's frontmatter; added a
   reciprocal sibling nav link from aneuploidy-detection. Contradictions: none — the artifact's
   Deviations and Assumptions section is None; the three Wikipedia sources agree and DD4/DD5 are
   architecture/nomenclature notes not departures. Follow-up: remaining Chromosome-analysis units

   Twentieth per-algorithm Evidence file; fourth of the Chromosome-analysis family (after ANEU, CENT,
   KARYO). Created the genuinely-distinct concept synteny-and-rearrangement-detection — deliberately
   named as the SHARED synteny anchor so the upcoming comparative-genomics COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 unit
   reuses it rather than re-deriving syntenic-block definitions. Two algorithms: `FindSyntenyBlocks`
   (group ortholog pairs by chromosome pair, sort by reference position, identify collinear runs, merge
   consecutive segments under maxGap, emit blocks ≥ minGenes; each block carries strand '+'/'-',
   GeneCount, and SequenceIdentity=NaN — not computable from coordinate-only input per MCScanX; I1–I5)
   and `DetectRearrangements` (sort blocks by ref chr/position, compare adjacent pairs: different target
   chr → Translocation, same target chr + different strand → Inversion, gap asymmetry → Deletion,
   overlapping source coords + different targets → Duplication; Type recognized-value + Position1 non-null
   + Chromosome2-differs invariants). Sources: Wikipedia Synteny/Comparative-genomics/Chromosomal-
   rearrangement + MCScanX (Wang 2012), SyRI (Goel 2019), Liu 2018, MUMmer. Oracles: collinear-forward
   (4 genes chr1→chrA → 1 block '+', 1000–8000), inverted block ('-'), translocation (chrA→chrB @ 50000),
   inversion (positions 50000/60000, size 10000). Captured artifact §7 coverage-strengthen (8 weak→exact,
   2 duplicate removed, 1 missing M16 maxGap-split implemented). Concise source page for the artifact.
   Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added CHROM-SYNT to that
   hub's frontmatter; added a reciprocal sibling nav link from aneuploidy-detection. Contradictions: none
   — the artifact's Deviations section is None; Wikipedia synteny/rearrangement definitions and MCScanX/
   SyRI tool descriptions agree; SequenceIdentity=NaN is MCScanX-backed. Follow-up: remaining Chromosome-

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CODON-CAI-001-Evidence.md → codon-cai-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twenty-second per-algorithm Evidence file; second of the codon-usage family (after ANNOT-CODONUSAGE/
   RSCU). Created the genuinely-distinct concept codon-adaptation-index (CAI, Sharp & Li 1987): a
   whole-gene directional codon-bias / expression-proxy score in [0,1] = geometric mean of relative
   adaptiveness w_i = f_i/max_synonym_f (family-MAX normalization, one level above RSCU's family
   normalization), equivalently exp((1/L)Σ ln w); the geometric mean makes it low-value-sensitive (one
   rare codon drags CAI down). Captured: stop codons excluded; single-codon Met/Trp w≡1 → canonical
   Sharp & Li 1987 / Jansen 2003 EXCLUSION rule (quoted verbatim in the artifact), exposed as the opt-in
   excludeSingleCodonAminoAcids flag (default includes them, historical); exclude can yield L=0→CAI 0;
   E. coli K12 (Kazusa 316407) oracles AUG→1.0, CUG-CCG-ACC→1.0, CUA-CCA-ACA→0.1980, plus the four
   exclusion-mode cases. Concise source page for the artifact (Wikipedia + Sharp & Li 1987 + Jansen 2003
   PMC2684136 + Kazusa sources). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   and added CODON-CAI to that hub's frontmatter; cross-linked bidirectionally with
   relative-synonymous-codon-usage (CAI reuses RSCU-style weights). One deviation: the Seqeron
   implementation clamps zero-frequency codons (freq=0 but family maxFreq>0) to w=1e-6 (incomplete-table
   protection) rather than strict w=0/log(0); unknown-AA/maxFreq=0 → NaN skipped; empty → 0.
   FLAGGED cross-page nuance (not a source contradiction): the RSCU page described CAI's log(0) guard as
   Sharp & Li's "0.5 pseudocount" (a reference-table-build convention) whereas this implementation uses
   a 1e-6 score-time clamp — reconciled the RSCU page wording and noted it on both pages. Sources agree
   internally (Wikipedia formulae = Sharp & Li = Jansen exclusion quote). Follow-up: remaining codon-usage
   units (CODON-ENC/OPT/RARE/STATS/USAGE, SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON) — ENC/optimization likely warrant
   their own concepts, raw frequency/usage tables may share existing concepts.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CODON-ENC-001-Evidence.md → codon-enc-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twenty-third per-algorithm Evidence file; third of the codon-usage family (after ANNOT-CODONUSAGE/
   RSCU, CODON-CAI). Created the genuinely-distinct concept effective-number-of-codons (ENC / Nc,
   Wright 1990): a reference-free whole-gene codon-bias measure in [20,61] = reciprocal of codon
   homozygosity F̂=(n·Σp_i²−1)/(n−1) aggregated by degeneracy class as Nc=2+9/F̂₂+1/F̂₃+5/F̂₄+3/F̂₆
   (constants = the standard-code partition: 2 singlets Met/Trp, 9 doublets, 1 triplet Ile, 5 quartets,
   3 sextets; stops excluded). 20 = max bias (one codon per aa), 61 = uniform usage; sampling
   WITHOUT replacement (Fuglsang 2006 superior estimator). Corner cases: n≤1 → F̂ undefined, drop and
   within-class-average (Eq. 4); Ile-absent 3-fold → F̂₃=(F̂₂+F̂₄)/2 fallback (Eq. 5a); Eq. 3 overshoot
   > 61 → re-adjust to 61; per-aa overshoot on small n. Oracles: unbiased→61, max-bias→20, Fuglsang
   no-bias-discrepancy sim→40.5, Phe TTT×3/TTC×1→F̂=0.5/Nc=2 (even split→3). One assumption: the
   Math.Max(20,…) lower clamp is a defensive bound NOT a Wright instruction (only re-adjust-DOWN-to-61
   is source-prescribed; 20 is the structural minimum). Concise source page for the artifact (Fuglsang

   Twenty-fourth per-algorithm Evidence file; fourth of the codon-usage family (after ANNOT-CODONUSAGE/
   RSCU, CODON-CAI, CODON-ENC). Created the genuinely-distinct concept codon-optimization — the family's
   sole *rewriting* operation (`OptimizeSequence`): synonymous-codon substitution to improve heterologous
   host expression, deliberately positioned as the ACTUATOR to RSCU/CAI/ENC's measurement. Five strategies
   each traced to a source point: MaximizeCAI (most-frequent codon, Sharp & Li 1987 CAI), BalancedOptimization
   (CAI vs 40-60% GC, rebuilds Changes list after GC balancing), HarmonizeExpression (match host distribution,
   Mignon 2018), AvoidRareCodons (replace only sub-threshold codons), MinimizeSecondary (delegates to
   BalancedOptimization for selection + dedicated ReduceSecondaryStructure). Invariants: protein preservation
   across all strategies (synonymous only), Met/AUG & Trp/UGG fixed points (single-codon families), stop

   codon-usage-bias + CAI + Plotkin-Kudla 2011 + Mignon 2018 + Kazusa sources). Linked new source + concept
   into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub and added CODON-OPT to that hub's frontmatter; cross-linked the
   new concept from codon-adaptation-index (MaximizeCAI drives CAI→1), relative-synonymous-codon-usage, and
   effective-number-of-codons (all three "sibling still in docs/Evidence" lines now resolve to the ingested
   page). Also removed stray `</content></invoke>` tags left at the tail of effective-number-of-codons.md
   (pre-existing Write artifact). Contradictions: none — Wikipedia strategy catalogue, Sharp & Li 1987,
   Plotkin-Kudla 2011 review and Mignon 2018 harmonization agree; behaviours recorded "from theory/
   implementation" so the correctness anchor is the protein-preservation invariant + CAI formula, both
   source-backed. Follow-up: remaining codon-usage units (CODON-RARE/STATS/USAGE, SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON)

   Twenty-fifth per-algorithm Evidence file; fifth of the codon-usage family (after ANNOT-CODONUSAGE/RSCU,
   CODON-CAI, CODON-ENC, CODON-OPT). Judged genuinely distinct — beyond a thresholded-frequency view, the
   2026-06-24 addendum adds two published cluster-detection algorithms with their own formulas and oracles —
   so created the concept rare-codon-analysis (the family's localization/diagnostic unit vs RSCU/CAI/ENC's
   whole-gene summaries; feeds codon-optimization's AvoidRareCodons). Base `FindRareCodons`: codon rare when
   per-family frequency < threshold (default 0.15), reports 0-indexed position(×3)/AA/actual-freq; E. coli
   K12 rare set AGA 0.04/AGG 0.02/CGA 0.06/CUA 0.04 (Kazusa MG1655); invariants (pos multiples of 3 in
   [0,len−3], freq∈[0,1], reported<threshold, deterministic), edges (empty→empty, non-÷3 trailing ignored,
   T→U, threshold 0/1 extremes, unknown codon→freq 0 always reported). Addendum cluster methods: Clarke &
   Clark 2008 %MinMax (per-AA synonymous Xij/Xmax/Xmin/Xavg, signed %Min/%Max ∈[−100,+100], default 18-codon
   window, rare clusters = negative %Min peaks) + Chartier/Gaudreault/Najmanovich 2012 Sherlocc (7-codon
   window, ≥4 of 7 "slow"=freq≤threshold positions → rare-codon cluster). Corner cases: single-codon AA
   (Met/Trp) contributes 0 to %MinMax num+denom → no divide-by-zero/NaN; window>seq → none; overlapping
   qualifying windows merged into one maximal cluster (flagged implementation choice, Sherlocc reports
   regions). Arg-family oracles AGA³→−86.36% / CGC³→+100% / CUG·AGA→+36.47% and Sherlocc 7×AGA→1 cluster /

   links from codon-optimization (AvoidRareCodons actuator) and codon-adaptation-index (localizes the low-w
   codons that pull CAI down). Contradictions: none — Deviations and Assumptions is None; the base
   threshold-frequency approach and the two complementary cluster methods each cite peer-reviewed sources
   plus a reference implementation; the overlapping-window merge is an explicitly flagged choice. Follow-up:

   Twenty-sixth per-algorithm Evidence file; sixth of the codon-usage family and the SECOND RSCU
   unit (after ANNOT-CODONUSAGE-001). REUSED the existing relative-synonymous-codon-usage concept
   rather than duplicating — this file validates the same n_i·x/Σx measure but adds the supporting
   `CountCodons` counting operation and a broader reference panel. No new concept created. Concise
   source page for the CODON-RSCU-001 artifact: Sharp/Tuohy/Mosurski 1986 (NAR 14(13):5125-5143, the
   RSCU-introducing paper) + LIRMM RSCU RS + GenomicSig (CRAN) + seqinr `uco` + cubar `est_rscu` +

   TTTTTC→1.0, Met ATGATG→1.0, CountCodons frame/exclusion (ATGAAATGA/ATGAA/ATGNNNAAA) datasets; two
   assumptions (absent-family 0/0→0 vs cubar pseudocount default 1; stop codons as a degeneracy-3
   family). Surgically updated the RSCU concept (added CODON-RSCU source + a 2nd relates_to
   test-unit-registry edge; documented the CountCodons counting contract and the primary-attribution
   note) and the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter + source-list). FLAGGED two cross-page
   nuances, neither a source contradiction: (1) stop-codon handling — the concept/ANNOT-CODONUSAGE say
   stops are EXCLUDED (Biopython forward_table) whereas CODON-RSCU says the repo treats the 3 stops as
   a degeneracy-3 synonymous family; both agree it never changes an amino-acid codon's RSCU; (2)
   primary attribution — CODON-RSCU + seqinr cite Sharp, Tuohy & Mosurski 1986 (the RSCU-introducing
   paper) whereas the concept/begomovirus restatement wrote "Sharp & Li 1986"; noted both on the
   concept. Sources internally consistent (LIRMM/GenomicSig/seqinr/Sharp-Tuohy-Mosurski algebraically
   identical; cubar pseudocount an explicit zero-division convention). Follow-up: remaining codon-usage
   units (CODON-STATS/USAGE, SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON) — raw frequency/usage tables may share
   existing concepts.

   Twenty-seventh per-algorithm Evidence file; seventh of the codon-usage family. NO new concept
   created — CODON-STATS-001 is the family's aggregation/reporting view (`GetStatistics` bundles codon
   counts + RSCU + ENC + CAI + positional GC + total codons; `CalculateCai` = the same CAI validated as
   CODON-CAI-001), so it REUSES the existing family concepts (relative-synonymous-codon-usage,
   codon-adaptation-index, effective-number-of-codons; cross-refs codon-optimization, rare-codon-analysis)
   rather than duplicating them — consistent with the "aggregation view reuses concepts" rule. The one
   piece not covered by an existing concept — positional GC composition (GC1/GC2/GC3, OverallGc, and
   GC3s = GC of *synonymous* third positions, excluding Met/Trp/stop, Peden 1999 §1.8.2.1.3 / EMBOSS cusp
   / PMC7596632 "59 synonymous codons") — is documented inline on the source page, not promoted to a
   concept (small facet of a stats bundle; a dedicated positional-GC unit can mint one later if needed).
   Sources: Sharp & Li 1987 (+ Biopython SharpEcoliIndex `w` reproduction) + Wikipedia + seqinr + CodonW/
   Peden thesis + EMBOSS cusp + Kazusa H. sapiens. Oracles: ATGGCA→GC3s 0 vs GC3 50 (shows the Met/Trp/
   stop exclusion), GCTGCC→CAI √0.122=0.34928…, ATGTGGTAA→CAI 0 (no scorable codon), CTGGTTAAA→GC1/GC2/
   GC3 66.67/0/33.33; EColiOptimalCodons reproduces Sharp&Li w, HumanOptimalCodons reproduces Kazusa RSCU
   (CTG≈2.3713). Two documented deviations: GC3s reported as a percentage (×100, EMBOSS-style, vs CodonW
   fraction — labeling only, subset exactly per Peden) and zero-`w` codons skipped rather than floored to
   0.01 (Bulmer 1988) — real-CDS CAI unaffected (no reference synonymous codon has w=0). Surgically updated
   the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-link list) and the RSCU base-anchor
   concept (noted CODON-STATS as the aggregation view + the GC3s definition). Contradictions: none — all
   sources agree on the formulae and the synonymous-codon exclusion set; the CAI zero-handling wording here
   (skip-zero-w) and CODON-CAI-001's (1e-6 clamp) describe the same guard from different angles, flagged on
   the source page. Follow-up: remaining codon-usage units (CODON-USAGE, SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON) — raw
   frequency/usage tables likely share existing concepts.
   graph: no typed edges (aggregation source reusing existing concepts; source pages can't be relates_to
   subjects per the ontology, so no new node warrants an edge; mentions auto-derived from wikilinks)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/CODON-USAGE-001-Evidence.md → codon-usage-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twenty-eighth per-algorithm Evidence file; eighth of the codon-usage family. Created ONE new concept
   codon-usage-comparison — the *raw* end of the family (`CalculateCodonUsage` + `CompareCodonUsage`).
   Judged genuinely distinct despite the "raw table likely reuses RSCU" hint: the raw counting IS the
   RSCU primitive (documented as reuse + a relates_to edge to relative-synonymous-codon-usage), but
   `CompareCodonUsage`'s Total Variation Distance similarity — Similarity = 1 − Σ|f₁−f₂|/2 ∈ [0,1] between
   two codon-frequency distributions, with proven identity 1.0 / symmetry / range / disjoint→0 /
   partial-overlap-exact properties — is a distribution-comparison operation no existing bias concept
   (RSCU/CAI/ENC/optimization/rare/stats) provides, so it warrants its own page. `CalculateCodonUsage`:
   non-overlapping triplets from offset 0, T→U internally, uppercase, drop partial trailing codon, returns
   unnormalized Dictionary<codon,int> (Σcounts=total invariant). Oracles: AUGGCUGCU→{AUG:1,GCU:2}, all-64
   codons→64 keys count 1; TVD sims identical→1.0, disjoint UUU/GGG→0, 2/3-shared→2/3, 0.5/0.75/0.75/0.25
   cases (all analytically derivable). Sources: Wikipedia codon-usage-bias (degeneracy) + Kazusa CUTG
   format + Sharp & Li 1987 (per-AA normalization) + Plotkin-Kudla 2011 + Athey 2017; predefined E. coli
   K12 / S. cerevisiae / H. sapiens tables Kazusa-verified (all 64 relative fractions, March 2026). Two
   deviations, both deliberate/benign: TVD-not-cosine metric choice (Wikipedia lists cosine + correlation;
   every test value derivable from the TVD formula and the 4 proven properties follow from TVD theory) and
   empty→similarity 0 (no data → 0, not NaN/exception). Concise source page for the artifact. Linked new
   source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and
   cross-linked from the RSCU base-anchor concept (raw-table sibling). Contradictions: none — Wikipedia,
   Kazusa, and Sharp & Li agree on the codon-usage biology; the TVD similarity is an implementation metric
   choice the sources don't contradict. Follow-up: remaining codon-usage units (SEQ-CODON-FREQ, TRANS-CODON)
   — raw frequency/usage tables may share codon-usage-comparison or RSCU rather than minting new concepts.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-ANI-001-Evidence.md → compgen-ani-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Twenty-ninth per-algorithm Evidence file; FIRST of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family. Created
   the genuinely-distinct concept average-nucleotide-identity — the anchor for the COMPGEN ANI
   genome-similarity family, sibling of the already-existing shared synteny anchor
   synteny-and-rearrangement-detection (ANI = how nucleotide-identical two genomes are; synteny = whether
   their gene order is conserved). ANIb definition traced verbatim to Goris et al. 2007 (IJSEM): fragment
   the query into consecutive 1020 nt pieces (mirrors ~1 kb DDH shearing), best-match place each against
   the reference, keep only fragments with >30% identity over ≥70% alignable length — BOTH recalculated
   over the full query-fragment length (pyani ani_pid=ani_alnids/qlen, ani_coverage=ani_alnlen/qlen, not
   the local sub-region) — and average the qualifying per-fragment identities; non-conserved fragments are
   discarded, not zero-scored. Species boundary ANI≈95%↔70% DDH (Goris; Konstantinidis & Tiedje 2005 ≈94%).
   2026-06-23 refresh resolved the old ungapped assumption: gapped Smith-Waterman placement (pyani BLASTN
   -xdrop_gap_final 150, ani_alnlen=blast_alnlen-blast_gaps) recovers indels (AAAACCCC/AAAATCCCC 0.875→1.0),
   and CalculateReciprocalAni implements the reciprocal/symmetric value = mean of both directions
   (order-independent, since only the query is fragmented → single-direction is asymmetric). Exact-arithmetic
   oracles (identical→1.0, one mismatch→0.9375, AATT→0.875, CGTC-excluded→1.0, ref<frag→0, query<frag→0);
   null/empty→0, non-positive fragmentLength→ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Concise source page for the
   artifact (Goris 2007 + Konstantinidis & Tiedje 2005 rank-1 + pyani rank-3 sources). Linked new source +
   concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and added a
   reciprocal sibling nav link from synteny-and-rearrangement-detection. One documented DECISION (not a
   correctness gap, not a deviation): the gapped path uses SequenceAligner.LocalAlign (full-DP Smith-Waterman,
   BLAST DNA scoring) rather than the NCBI BLASTN engine — more sensitive than BLAST's heuristic seeding, same
   recalculated-over-fragment identity/coverage; numeric ANI may differ slightly from NCBI-BLASTN pipelines,
   indel handling correct (algorithm doc §5.3). Contradictions: none — Goris, Konstantinidis & Tiedje, and
   pyani agree on fragmentation, cut-offs, averaging, gapped placement, and reciprocal computation. Follow-up:
   remaining COMPGEN units (orthologs/RBH, COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 which reuses synteny-and-rearrangement-detection,
   reversal distance, dot-plot, conserved gene clusters) warrant their own concepts or share existing ones when

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-CLUSTER-001-Evidence.md → compgen-cluster-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirtieth per-algorithm Evidence file; second of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family (after ANI).
   Created the genuinely-distinct concept conserved-gene-clusters-common-intervals — a conserved gene
   cluster = a gene-label SET that is contiguous (an interval) in EVERY genome, order- and strand-free
   inside the window: the common-interval model. Distinct from both COMPGEN siblings — ANI measures
   nucleotide identity, synteny requires a COLLINEAR ORDERED block, a common interval only requires the
   same gene SET contiguous in each genome. Definitions traced verbatim to Uno & Yagiura 2000
   (Algorithmica, originating common-interval model, O(n²) LHP + output-sensitive O(n+K) RC), Heber &
   Stoye 2001 (CPM, k-permutation generalisation, optimal O(kn+z)/O(n)), Bui-Xuan/Habib/Paul 2013
   (MinMax-Profiles arXiv:1304.5140, unifying view: interval [i,j] defined only for i<j → size ≥2,
   singletons excluded, whole set (1..n) always common; golden-vector Example 1), and Didier et al. 2013
   (arXiv:1310.4290, extension permutations→sequences with duplicates: paralogs handled, a set is common
   iff SOME contiguous window/location in each genome has exactly that label set). Seqeron does the simple
   strict O(n²·K_genomes) check with a minClusterSize filter; K≥2 required (single genome → every interval
   trivially common). Oracles: golden vector Id₇ vs (7 2 1 3 6 4 5) → non-trivial {1,2}/{1,2,3}/{3,4,5,6}/
   {4,5}/{4,5,6}/{1..6} + trivial {1..7} (brute-force reproduced); split-negative {2,3} (positions 2,4 in
   genome 2 → non-adjacent); sequence-with-duplicates T/S → {1,2} not common, {1,2,3,4} common. Concise
   source page for the artifact (Uno & Yagiura 2000 + Heber & Stoye 2001 + Bui-Xuan/Habib/Paul 2013 +
   Didier et al. 2013, all rank-1). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and added reciprocal sibling nav links from
   average-nucleotide-identity and synteny-and-rearrangement-detection. ONE documented ASSUMPTION (API-shape,
   not a correctness gap): the public method keeps a maxGap parameter but the validated/tested behaviour is
   the STRICT gap-free common-interval model — maxGap does NOT relax it, and the gene-teams gapped extension
   (Bergeron, Corteel & Raffinot 2002) is NOT implemented (source not retrievable). Contradictions: none —
   the four sources agree on the interval definition, the contiguous-in-every-genome cluster rule, the
   size-≥2 constraint, and the sequence-with-duplicates generalisation. Follow-up: remaining COMPGEN units
   (orthologs/RBH, COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 reusing synteny-and-rearrangement-detection, reversal distance,
   dot-plot, genome-comparison pipeline) warrant their own concepts or share existing ones when ingested.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-COMPARE-001-Evidence.md → compgen-compare-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirty-first per-algorithm Evidence file; third of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family (after ANI,
   CLUSTER). This one is an ORCHESTRATING PIPELINE, not a single-metric unit: `CompareGenomes` performs the
   end-to-end two-genome comparison, partitioning each genome's genes into a CORE (conserved) set and a
   DISPENSABLE (genome-specific) set and reporting an OverallSynteny fraction. Created the genuinely-distinct
   concept genome-comparison-core-dispensable — distinct because it composes sub-units into the pairwise
   pan-genome model (Tettelin et al. 2005 PNAS, the paper that coined pan-genome/core/dispensable): core =
   the reciprocal-best-hit ortholog pairs (Moreno-Hagelsieb & Latimer 2008 + Tatusov 1997, COMPGEN-RBH-001),
   dispensable = the rest of each genome; outputs Conserved/Specific1/Specific2 + OverallSynteny = (genes in
   MCScanX syntenic blocks)/min(|g1|,|g2|) clamped ≤1 (fraction-of-syntenic-genes metric; blocks from MCScanX
   Wang 2012 = COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001, min 5 collinear anchors). Oracles: one-shared-one-unique → 1/1/1,
   disjoint → 0/2/2, identical-5-collinear+1-unique → Conserved 5, Specific 1/1, OverallSynteny 5/6=0.8333,
   0 rearrangements; symmetric partition (swap g1/g2 swaps Specific1/Specific2); empty genomes → all 0.
   Concise source page for the artifact (Tettelin 2005 + Moreno-Hagelsieb 2008/Tatusov 1997 + ScienceDirect/
   Wikipedia synteny overview + MCScanX Wang 2012 sources). Linked new source + concept into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and added reciprocal sibling nav
   links from average-nucleotide-identity, conserved-gene-clusters-common-intervals, and
   synteny-and-rearrangement-detection. TWO documented ASSUMPTIONs, both source-backed, neither a
   partition-logic gap: (1) alignment-free 5-mer Jaccard RBH gate (identity ≥0.3, coverage ≥0.5) replaces the
   Tettelin 50%/50% alignment gate, inherited verbatim from COMPGEN-RBH-001 — partition logic unchanged;
   (2) MCScanX ≥5-collinear-anchor block threshold means OverallSynteny can be 0 even when conserved orthologs
   exist. Contradictions: none — Tettelin (core/dispensable), Moreno-Hagelsieb/Tatusov (RBH), and the synteny
   sources each govern a distinct pipeline output and are mutually consistent; Deviations = None. Follow-up:
   remaining COMPGEN units (RBH orthologs, reversal distance, dot-plot) warrant their own concepts when ingested.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-DOTPLOT-001-Evidence.md → compgen-dotplot-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirty-second per-algorithm Evidence file; fourth of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family (after ANI,
   CLUSTER, COMPARE). Created the genuinely-distinct concept dot-plot-word-match — genuinely distinct from the
   metric (ANI), ordered-block (synteny), gene-set (conserved-clusters), and pipeline (genome-comparison)
   siblings because it is the VISUAL word-match / k-tuple dot matrix that keeps the whole match relation as a
   2-D plot. Algorithm traced verbatim: dot at (x,y) iff the length-`wordSize` word starting at x in sequence1
   exactly matches the word at y in sequence2 (EMBOSS `dottup` exact word match — NOT scored `dotmatcher`),
   case-insensitive (both upper-cased), x=seq1 / y=seq2, all overlapping occurrences via suffix tree; `wordSize`
   default 10 (EMBOSS) is the noise-vs-sensitivity trade-off (longer=less noise/faster/less sensitive), `stepSize`
   subsamples x. Diagonals = similarity, main diagonal = self-comparison, repeats = extra diagonals, indels break
   the diagonal (Wikipedia). Oracles: Huttley `AGCGT`/`AT` k=1 → exactly {(0,0),(4,1)}; `ACGTACGT` self wordSize4
   → {(0,0),(0,4),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,0),(4,4)} (all overlapping word starts); `ACGT` self main diagonal.
   Corner cases: word>sequence / null / empty / disjoint-alphabet → no dots; non-positive wordSize/stepSize →
   ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Sources: Gibbs & McIntyre 1970 (Eur.J.Biochem. 16:1–11, rank 1, paywalled → method

   Wikipedia Dot plot (rank 4) + Huttley TIB Dotplot (rank 4, k=1 worked example). Concise source page for the
   artifact. Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both
   link lists) and added a reciprocal sibling nav link from average-nucleotide-identity. TWO ASSUMPTIONs, both
   explicitly non-correctness-affecting: (1) coordinate orientation x=seq1/y=seq2 (a presentation convention;
   transposing mirrors the plot but not the match set as a relation); (2) case-insensitive comparison (dottup/Gibbs
   do not mandate case folding; impl upper-cases both). Contradictions: none — Gibbs & McIntyre (via secondaries),
   Wikipedia, EMBOSS dottup, and Huttley agree on the exact-word match rule, diagonals-as-similarity, and the
   wordSize noise/sensitivity trade-off; Deviations = None. Follow-up: remaining COMPGEN units (RBH orthologs,
   COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 reusing synteny-and-rearrangement-detection, reversal distance) warrant their own concepts

   Thirty-third per-algorithm Evidence file; fifth of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family (after ANI,
   CLUSTER, COMPARE, DOTPLOT). Created the genuinely-distinct concept ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits
   — the homology-classification unit and the shared RBH/ortholog anchor deliberately scoped so the future
   COMPGEN-RBH-001 unit reuses it, and the already-ingested genome-comparison-core-dispensable pipeline's
   conserved/core set IS these RBH pairs. Two rules traced verbatim: (1) ORTHOLOGS by Reciprocal Best Hits
   (Moreno-Hagelsieb & Latimer 2008: two genes in two genomes are orthologs iff each is the other's best hit;
   Tatusov 1997 COG symmetrical best hits; Fitch 1970 orthology=speciation / paralogy=duplication) — best hit
   = max-similarity candidate with deterministic tie-break (descending bit-score then ascending E-value),
   RECIPROCITY MANDATORY so a one-directional best hit (A→B, B→C≠A) is NOT an ortholog (the guarded defect
   class), ≥50% coverage gate + max E-value 1e-6 significance gate; (2) recent (IN-)PARALOGS by within-genome
   mutual best hits (Remm/Storm/Sonnhammer 2001 InParanoid in-paralog rule; out-paralogs pre-speciation
   excluded). Partial-matching output, determinism, empty-sequence/null contracts. Oracles: reciprocity
   {a1↔b1,a2↔b2}, non-reciprocity (b2=a1's superstring shares all 5-mers but a1↛b2 → RBH count 1), in-paralog

   already-ingested genome-comparison-core-dispensable concept (replaced its bare "COMPGEN-RBH-001" reference
   with [[ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits]] in the intro + core/conserved bullet) and added a
   navigation link in the compgen-compare-001-evidence source page. ONE ASSUMPTION, source-backed and
   non-correctness-affecting: alignment-free 5-mer Jaccard replaces the BLAST bit-score ranking (the
   ComparativeGenomics class does not reference the Alignment project; cf. Mash) — affects only which
   near-identical pair wins ties; the RBH reciprocity rule, coverage gate (→ shared k-mers ≥50% of smaller
   set), and min-similarity gate are source-backed. Contradictions: none — Fitch/Tatusov/Moreno-Hagelsieb/Remm
   are mutually consistent, each governing a distinct part of the rule; Deviations = None beyond the metric
   substitution. Follow-up: COMPGEN-RBH-001 (apparent RBH duplicate) shares this concept rather than
   duplicating; remaining COMPGEN units (COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 reusing synteny-and-rearrangement-detection,
   reversal distance) warrant their own concepts or share existing ones.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-RBH-001-Evidence.md → compgen-rbh-001-evidence (source)
   Thirty-fourth per-algorithm Evidence file; sixth of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family (after
   ANI, CLUSTER, COMPARE, DOTPLOT, ORTHO). NO new concept — this file is the RBH-only slice of the
   already-ingested COMPGEN-ORTHO-001, and the ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits concept was
   deliberately scoped (during the ORTHO ingest) as the shared RBH anchor COMPGEN-RBH-001 reuses.
   Reused that concept: added COMPGEN-RBH-001 to its sources frontmatter and rewrote its intro to cite
   BOTH validation records (COMPGEN-ORTHO-001 = RBH + within-genome in-paralog; COMPGEN-RBH-001 = the
   between-genome ortholog slice, no in-paralog rule). Distinctive content vs ORTHO: only TWO sources
   (Moreno-Hagelsieb & Latimer 2008 operational RBH + thresholds; Tatusov 1997 COG genome-specific BeTs/
   mutually-consistent-best-hit triangles) — no Fitch, no Remm, no in-paralog dataset; verbatim quotes
   from the fetched OUP article (best hit = descending bit-score then ascending E-value; ≥50% coverage of
   "any of the protein sequences"; max E-value 1e-6); and an in-file DATA-QUALITY note where a
   search-engine summary claiming a 60% coverage threshold was rejected in favor of the article body's
   50% (recorded as a resolved discrepancy, not a source-vs-source contradiction). Datasets: reciprocity
   {a1↔b1,a2↔b2}, non-reciprocity (b2 = a1's superstring shares all 5-mers but a1↛b2 → RBH count 1),
   coverage/min-identity gate. Concise source page written; linked into the algorithm-validation-evidence
   hub (frontmatter sources + link list). ONE ASSUMPTION, source-backed: alignment-free 5-mer Jaccard
   replaces the BLAST bit-score ranking (cf. Mash) — affects only near-identical tie-breaks; reciprocity/
   coverage/threshold semantics unchanged. Contradictions: none between sources (Tatusov symmetrical BeTs
   and Moreno-Hagelsieb operational RBH are consistent, the latter the pairwise operationalization of the
   former); Deviations = None beyond the metric substitution. No new typed graph edges (reused existing
   concept, no new concept/relationship; mentions auto-derived).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-REARR-001-Evidence.md → compgen-rearr-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirty-fifth per-algorithm Evidence file; seventh of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family
   (after ANI, CLUSTER, COMPARE, DOTPLOT, ORTHO, RBH). Created a NEW concept
   genome-rearrangement-breakpoint-distance — the signed-permutation / breakpoint formulation of
   rearrangement detection (Hannenhalli–Pevzner / Bafna–Pevzner), genuinely distinct from the existing
   block-signal synteny-and-rearrangement-detection (CHROM-SYNT-001), which classifies from adjacent
   synteny-block coordinates. Modeled the two as alternative_to: this unit counts breakpoints b(α) on a
   signed permutation (extended (0,…,n+1), breakpoint = consecutive pair where neither (x,y) nor (−y,−x)
   survives in β), reports the breakpoint distance d_BP=n−sim(common adjacencies) and the reversal-distance
   lower bound d≥b/2, and ClassifyRearrangement returns Inversion (sign-flip reversal) vs Transposition
   (orientation-preserving block move) — Translocation/Deletion/Insertion/Duplication are a documented
   "Not implemented" (a single in-order permutation can't express them). Sources all rank 1: Hunter
   College Lecture 16 (verbatim signed-permutation/reversal/breakpoint/lower-bound), Tannier–Zheng–Sankoff
   PMC3887456 (adjacency vocabulary + d=n−sim + telomeres), Bafna–Pevzner 1998 (transposition vs inversion).
   Oracles: Hunter α=(−2,−3,+1,+6,−5,−4)→b=6/d≥3 with (−5,−4) excluded via (−y,−x); identity→0;
   single reversed block (+1,−4,−3,−2,+5)→b=2. Three source-backed ASSUMPTIONS (orthologMap-supplied
   anchors delegating anchor generation to the ORTHO/synteny units; strand '+'/'-'=sign; only
   Inversion/Transposition classified). Concise source page written; linked into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + concept-list); added a reciprocal
   "two formulations" note on synteny-and-rearrangement-detection; index updated (source + concept lines).
   Contradictions: none among sources; Deviations = None beyond the three scoping assumptions.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-REVERSAL-001-Evidence.md → compgen-reversal-001-evidence (source)
   Thirty-sixth per-algorithm Evidence file; eighth of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family
   (after ANI, CLUSTER, COMPARE, DOTPLOT, ORTHO, RBH, REARR). NO new concept — this file is NOT a
   distinct algorithm: CalculateReversalDistance computes the SAME reversal-distance lower bound
   d≥b/2 already documented in genome-rearrangement-breakpoint-distance (COMPGEN-REARR-001), only on
   UNSIGNED gene-order indices (breakpoint = |π_{i+1}−π_i|≠1 on the extended perm, the magnitude
   specialization of the signed criterion per Bafna–Pevzner §2 / Hübotter 2020) and returning the
   tightest integer ⌈b/2⌉=(b+1)/2 rather than a raw breakpoint count. It is a lower bound, NOT the
   exact distance (no Hannenhalli–Pevzner cycle/hurdle refinement). Reused that concept: added a new
   "Unsigned reversal distance ⌈b/2⌉" subsection with the unsigned breakpoint rule + oracle table,
   added COMPGEN-REVERSAL to its frontmatter sources (source_commit bumped to c6c3b01), and added a
   relates_to test-unit-registry typed edge for the new source. Sources: Bafna–Pevzner 1998 (rank 1,
   breakpoint def + lower-bound construction, identity=only 0-breakpoint perm), Hunter Lecture 16
   (rank 2, reversal removes ≤2, d≥b/2, symmetry d_β(α)=d_α(β)), Hübotter 2020 survey (rank 4,
   unsigned |Δ|≠1 specialization, corroboration only), Bergeron–Mixtacki–Stoye 2009 (rank 1,
   adjacency-vs-breakpoint). Oracles (unsigned): [2,3,1,6,5,4]→b=4→2, [4,3,2,1]→b=2→1, identity→0.
   Two source-backed ASSUMPTIONS: integer ⌈b/2⌉ rounding (tightest integer the theorem guarantees),
   unequal-length inputs throw ArgumentException (distance defined only within one marker set).
   Concise source page written; linked into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources
   + source-list) and the genome-rearrangement-breakpoint-distance concept; index updated (source line
   + concept-entry now marks COMPGEN-REARR-001 + COMPGEN-REVERSAL-001). Contradictions: none —
   signed/unsigned criteria are the same rule under |Δ|; Deviations = None beyond the two assumptions.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001-Evidence.md → compgen-synteny-001-evidence (source)
   Thirty-seventh per-algorithm Evidence file; ninth of the Comparative-genomics (COMPGEN) family
   (after ANI, CLUSTER, COMPARE, DOTPLOT, ORTHO, RBH, REARR, REVERSAL). NO new concept — REUSED the
   existing shared synteny anchor synteny-and-rearrangement-detection (created for CHROM-SYNT-001,
   which was pre-named as the anchor COMPGEN-SYNTENY would reuse). This file is the comparative-genomics
   whole-genome counterpart and supplies the concrete MCScanX collinearity DP scoring parameters behind
   that anchor's FindSyntenyBlocks: chain DP Score(v)=max(MatchScore(v), max_u[Score(u)+MatchScore(v)+
   GapPenalty×NumberofGaps(u,v)]), MatchScore 50 / GapPenalty −1 / MAX_GAPS 25, report non-overlapping
   chains scoring over 250 (≥5 collinear anchor pairs), both transcriptional directions → forward +
   inverted (IsInverted) blocks, anchors from BLASTP E≤1e-5 with <5-gene collapse (generation delegated
   to COMPGEN-ORTHO-001). Enriched the concept with a new "MCScanX collinearity DP model" section + the
   scoring block, and updated its intro to record dual validation (CHROM-SYNT-001 chromosome-scale +
   COMPGEN-SYNTENY-001 whole-genome). Sources: MCScanX (Wang 2012, PMC3326336, rank 1, verbatim
   recurrence/params) + MCScanX Oxford HTML (synteny-vs-collinearity, anchors=homologs) + Wikipedia
   Synteny (rank 4, definitions). Oracles: 5 forward anchors→score 250→forward block; reversed order→
   inverted block; 4 anchors→score 200→no block; ≥25-gene gap→chain breaks; empty→no blocks. Two
   source-backed ASSUMPTIONS: report rule ≥250 AND ≥5 pairs (resolves the "over 250" vs "≥5 pairs"
   wording tension in favour of the explicit 5-pair minimum); anchors supplied as an orthologMap.
   Concise source page written; linked into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources +
   source-list + concept-list); index updated (source line). Contradictions: none — the two MCScanX
   renderings and Wikipedia agree; Deviations = None beyond the two scoping assumptions.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/DISORDER-LC-001-Evidence.md → disorder-lc-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirty-eighth per-algorithm Evidence file; FIRST of the protein disorder / features family
   (DISORDER-LC / MORF / PRED / PROPENSITY / REGION). Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   protein-low-complexity-seg — the anchor for the protein-disorder/features family: the SEG algorithm
   (Wootton & Federhen 1993/1996) partitioning a protein into low- and high-complexity segments.
   Complexity = Shannon entropy H=−Σpᵢ·log₂pᵢ in bits/residue (max log₂20≈4.322), matching NCBI
   `blast_seg.c` `s_Entropy`; two-stage scan with three parameters W=12 (trigger window) / K1=2.2
   (trigger/locut cutoff) / K2=2.5 (extension/hicut cutoff), all verbatim NCBI/GCG defaults: stage-1
   triggers windows with entropy ≤ K1, stage-2 extends while ≤ K2. Judged genuinely distinct — SEG
   low-complexity is a different algorithm from intrinsic-disorder prediction (TOP-IDP) / MoRFs, so
   PRED/PROPENSITY/MORF/REGION are expected to warrant their own concept(s); and it is the PROTEIN
   counterpart of the genomic-DNA low-complexity under repetitive-element-detection (different alphabet
   + complexity measure), so I did NOT fold it into that repeats anchor. Hand-derived oracle window
   entropies (L=12): QQ..→0.0 triggers, AAAAAALLLLLL→1.0 triggers, AAABBBCCCDDD→2.0 triggers@K1=2.2
   (not strict 0.5), ACDEFGHIKLMN 12-distinct→3.584963>K2 no segment; corner cases seq<W→empty,
   homopolymer≥W→one full-span segment, all-distinct→none. Concise source page for the artifact (NCBI
   `blast_seg.c` rank-3 reference impl + GCG/Weizmann SEG help & `ncbi-seg` manpage rank-3 + Wootton &
   Federhen 1993 C&C 17(2):149-163 / 1996 Meth.Enzymol. 266:554-571 rank-1 primary). Linked new source
   + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and
   updated the index (source + concept lines). TWO documented ASSUMPTIONs, both flagged as deviations
   from Wootton & Federhen but neither moving segment boundaries on the canonical cases: (1) region-type
   label string "X-rich"/"X/Y-rich" (dominant-residue >50% presentation extension — SEG defines only
   segment location, not a label); (2) greedy single-residue extension (grow contig one residue at a
   time while whole-segment entropy ≤ K2 vs the reference merge of length-W extension windows — identical
   boundaries on homopolymer/dipeptide oracles). Contradictions: none — the NCBI reference impl, the
   GCG/manpage program docs, and the Wootton & Federhen primary literature agree on W=12/K1=2.2/K2=2.5,
   the Shannon-entropy bits/residue measure, and the two-stage trigger/extend scan. Follow-up: remaining
   protein-disorder units (MORF/PRED/PROPENSITY/REGION) warrant their own concept(s) — likely a shared
   intrinsic-disorder (TOP-IDP) anchor distinct from this low-complexity one — when ingested.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/DISORDER-MORF-001-Evidence.md → disorder-morf-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Thirty-ninth per-algorithm Evidence file; SECOND of the protein disorder / features family
   (after DISORDER-LC-001 / SEG low-complexity). Created the genuinely-distinct concept
   morf-prediction-dip-in-disorder — MoRF (Molecular Recognition Feature) prediction by the "dip
   within disorder" heuristic. A MoRF = a short ordered segment embedded in a longer intrinsically
   disordered region that undergoes a disorder-to-order transition on partner binding. Criterion
   traced verbatim: Seqeron reports a MoRF where an ordered run (per-residue disorder score < 0.5,
   the PMC2570644 threshold) of TOTAL length within the Mohan 2006 10–70 residue band is flanked on
   BOTH sides by a disordered residue (score ≥ 0.5) inside a disordered region; terminal dips (not
   flanked both sides) excluded. Per-residue score from `PredictDisorder` = TOP-IDP scale (Campen
   2008) normalized `(raw+0.884)/1.871` to [0,1]; window averaging smooths boundaries. Mohan 2006
   α/β/ι bound-state sub-types recorded; MoRF score∈[0,1] rising with dip depth (bounded
   normalization = documented derivation, 0.5 threshold source-backed). Judged distinct from the SEG
   [[protein-low-complexity-seg]] sibling — SEG partitions by compositional complexity, MoRF reads a
   per-residue disorder profile for an ordered dip (the DISORDER-LC ingest had pre-flagged MORF as
   warranting its own concept). Oracle: synthetic ordered-L-dip in long P/E disordered flanks → one
   MoRF; corner cases fully-ordered/fully-disordered/out-of-10–70-band/terminal-dip → none. Concise
   source page for the artifact (Mohan 2006 J Mol Biol PMID 16935303 rank-1 + Cheng/Oldfield
   PMC2570644 rank-1 "dip" operational def + Oldfield 2005 Biochemistry PMID 16156658 rank-1 +
   Wikipedia rank-4; Campen 2008 TOP-IDP for the underlying score). Linked new source + concept into
   the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter + both link lists) and updated the index
   (source + concept lines); added a reciprocal sibling nav link from protein-low-complexity-seg.
   ONE documented ASSUMPTION, scoped to the flank-length detail only: Oldfield 2005's exact numeric
   dip parameters (flank lengths, ordered-run window) are PAYWALLED and unretrievable, so the unit
   implements the fully-retrievable qualitative criterion — the 0.5 threshold, the 10–70 band, and
   the order-within-disorder shape are all source-traceable and NOT assumptions. Contradictions:
   none — Mohan/Cheng-Oldfield/Oldfield/Wikipedia agree on the 10–70 length, the short-order-within-
   longer-disorder shape, and the disorder-to-order transition. Follow-up: remaining protein-disorder
   units (PRED/PROPENSITY/REGION) warrant their own concept(s) — a shared intrinsic-disorder (TOP-IDP)
   `PredictDisorder` anchor is the likely next distinct concept.

## [2026-07-09] lint | structural + staleness + coverage + graph (89 pages)
   Structural: 1 orphan (readme) — fixed by adding a reciprocal [[readme]] content link
   from three-front-doors (README is that concept's source). Staleness: clean. Graph
   lint: clean (no typed-edge issues). Coverage: 1135 uncovered — the step-7 "report too
   long" signal; dominated by generated/reference material, not real gaps. Triaged with
   the user in batch:
   - Added a Coverage exclude policy to SCHEMA.md for generated subtrees (docs/mcp/tools/**
     427 tool docs, docs/Validation/reports/** per-run reports, docs/refactoring/**,
     docs/skills/_generated/**, docs/templates/**) → residual coverage drops to 405.
   - docs/algorithms/** kept IN scope. Reconciliation found step-1 already done: every
     existing algorithm concept already lists its docs/algorithms doc in sources: (commit
     9ce49ba, staleness-clean) → no frontmatter edits/source_commit bumps needed. 37 docs
     covered-via-concept, 208 pending (+2 index/map docs README/CANONICAL_MAP noted).
   - Created wiki/backlog.md (type: index): covered→concept table, pending grouped by 34
     domains with expected slugs (Oncology 37 / MolTools 17 / RnaStructure 13 / … the
     largest gaps), and the three approved queued source batches (10 testing checklists,
     4 Validation ledgers, 3 MCP top-level docs incl. MCP_STATUS.md). Pending list folds
     into the main per-algorithm ingest campaign, not a separate one. Registered under a
     new Meta section in index.md.
   - Known residual lint noise, accepted by design: backlog.md reads as an orphan (index-
     only inbound link, same quirk as readme pre-fix — it is an index-discoverable meta
     page) and trips the 400-line soft cap (488 lines; a flat reference table, well under
     the 800 hard cap, not worth sharding).
   Cadence note: coverage should always be run with the SCHEMA exclude globs from now on;
   without them every lint re-surfaces the ~693-doc generated long-tail.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/DISORDER-PRED-001-Evidence.md → disorder-pred-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fortieth per-algorithm Evidence file; THIRD of the protein disorder / features family (after
   DISORDER-LC-001 / SEG and DISORDER-MORF-001 / MoRF). Created the genuinely-distinct SHARED
   anchor concept intrinsic-disorder-prediction-top-idp — the TOP-IDP `PredictDisorder`
   sliding-window intrinsic-disorder predictor that MoRF prediction + disordered-region detection
   sit on (the "likely next distinct concept" flagged by the MORF ingest follow-up; NOT previously
   represented — only referenced inline on the morf page). Per-residue Sᵢ = mean over a window
   (default 21, edge-clipped) of min-max-normalized TOP-IDP `(p−(−0.884))/1.871 ∈ [0,1]`, disordered
   when Sᵢ ≥ 0.542 (Campen 2008 maximum-likelihood cutoff); Dunker 2001 disorder{A,R,G,Q,S,P,E,K} /
   order{W,C,F,I,Y,V,L,N} / ambiguous{D,H,M,T} sets; Kyte-Doolittle `CalculateHydropathy` utility;
   W30→0.0 / P30→1.0 / E30→0.866 homopolymer oracles; null/empty→empty, non-canonical residues
   skipped (all-unknown window→0.0), case-insensitive, O(n·w). Sources: Campen 2008 (PMC2676888
   rank-1 primary, TOP-IDP Table 2 + cutoff) + Dunker 2001 + Kyte-Doolittle 1982 + Wikipedia rank-3;
   concept also lists docs/algorithms/ProteinPred/Disorder_Prediction.md as a second source (SEG
   precedent; aids backlog reconciliation). Cross-linked: MoRF concept now `depends_on` this anchor
   (replaced its inline PredictDisorder prose with a wikilink) and SEG concept + index updated to
   point at the now-existing concept; linked into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter
   + both link lists) and index (source + concept lines). Assumptions: None in the evidence file —
   every parameter (TOP-IDP scale, 0.542 cutoff, Dunker sets, hydropathy) is source-traced;
   implementation-side note only = explicitly SIMPLIFIED single-feature TOP-IDP heuristic, not
   competitive with IUPred2A/MobiDB-lite, non-canonical residues skipped, edge windows clipped.
   Contradictions: none — the PRED unit's 0.542 max-likelihood cutoff vs the MoRF unit's 0.5
   order/disorder threshold (PMC2570644) are different published thresholds for different purposes,
   flagged as such, NOT a contradiction. Follow-up: remaining protein-disorder units (PROPENSITY /
   REGION — Disorder_Propensity.md, Disordered_Region_Detection.md) can reuse this anchor;
   Disordered_Region_Detection is the aggregation layer over PredictDisorder's per-residue calls.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/DISORDER-PROPENSITY-001-Evidence.md → disorder-propensity-001-evidence (source)
   Fourth protein-disorder-family unit. NOT a new algorithm — the RAW per-residue propensity
   primitive layer beneath PredictDisorder, so REUSED/enriched the existing anchor concept
   [[intrinsic-disorder-prediction-top-idp]] rather than creating a new one (as the DISORDER-PRED
   log entry anticipated). Four in-scope methods: GetDisorderPropensity (returns the RAW
   un-normalized TOP-IDP Table-2 value W−0.884…P+0.987 — explicitly NOT the [0,1] normalized Sᵢ the
   windowed predictor uses; unknown residue→0.0 via GetValueOrDefault; case-folded), IsDisorderPromoting,
   and the two public sets DisorderPromotingAminoAcids={A,E,G,K,P,Q,R,S} / OrderPromotingAminoAcids=
   {C,F,I,L,N,V,W,Y} (with ambiguous {D,H,M,T} in neither; three sets disjoint + cover all 20 = 8+8+4).
   Sources: Campen 2008 (PMC2676888 rank-1, Table 2 raw values + anchors) + Wikipedia IDP (rank-4, for
   the Dunker 2001 classification it cites) + Dunker 2001 PubMed (rank-1 citation locator). Enriched
   the concept with a new "Per-residue propensity primitives" section (raw-vs-normalized value-space
   caveat), added the new evidence path to its frontmatter sources + bumped source_commit, and
   cross-linked from the intro. Updated index (new source line + concept line now names both units).
   Assumptions: two, both implementation-side, not source contradictions — (1) unknown-residue
   propensity 0.0 = GetValueOrDefault contract not a source value; (2) ranking-string vs Table-2-value
   S/K discrepancy (rendered "…Q,K,S,E,P" but S=0.341<K=0.586 → by value "…Q,S,K,E,P"; numeric values
   authoritative, no correctness impact). The 0.542 cutoff is recorded in-source for completeness but
   governs PredictDisorder, NOT this unit's four methods. Contradictions: none. Follow-up: only the
   REGION unit (Disordered_Region_Detection.md, the contiguous-run aggregation layer over
   PredictDisorder) remains in the protein-disorder family.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/DISORDER-REGION-001-Evidence.md → disorder-region-001-evidence (source)
   Fifth (and final anticipated) protein-disorder-family unit. NOT a new algorithm — the contiguous-run
   AGGREGATION + region-classification layer over the per-residue PredictDisorder TOP-IDP profile, so
   REUSED/enriched the existing anchor concept [[intrinsic-disorder-prediction-top-idp]] rather than
   creating a new one (exactly the growth the DISORDER-PRED/PROPENSITY log entries anticipated). Added a
   new "Disordered-region detection (DISORDER-REGION-001)" section to the anchor: contiguous run ≥
   minRegionLength(5) with MeanScore + boundary oracles (empty/all-ordered→no regions, all-disordered→one
   region, isolated<minLen→none, trailing region no off-by-one), and a two-scheme classification table.

   else Long IDR(len>30, van der Lee)/Standard IDR; opt-in ClassifyRegionFlavorMobiDbLite (Necci 2020 v3

   Cys→Pro→Gly→SEG→Polar{S,T,N,Q} at ≥0.32 inclusive, 9-residue window, sub-region≥9; boundaries + rescaled

   intro; updated index (new source line + anchor concept line now names all three PRED/PROPENSITY/REGION
   units + region-detection layer). CONTRADICTION flagged (in-source ref #6): the default RegionType 0.25
   composition cutoff is an internal ~5×-random heuristic, NOT Das&Pappu 2013's 0.25 — that value is NCPR,
   a globule/coil conformational-state threshold, not a compositional-enrichment threshold; MobiDB-lite's
   own 0.35/0.32 thresholds ARE source-exact. Follow-up: none — the protein-disorder family (LC/MoRF/PRED/

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/EPIGEN-AGE-001-Evidence.md → epigen-age-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   FIRST unit of the NEW Epigenetics family (EPIGEN-AGE-001) — epigenetic ("DNAm") age via the Horvath
   2013 multi-tissue DNA-methylation clock. Surveyed wiki/concepts: NO pre-existing epigenetics /
   methylation / CpG concept to reuse (grep hits in log/backlog/registry were incidental), so created a
   genuinely-distinct anchor concept [[epigenetic-age-horvath-clock]] — the two-stage scorer: linear
   predictor Y = intercept + Σ coef_i·β_i over 353 elastic-net-selected clock CpGs (transformed-age
   units), then the two-branch Horvath inverse calibration `anti.trafo` (adult.age=20): 21·exp(Y)−1 for
   Y<0, 21·Y+20 for Y≥0, continuous at (0,20)=age 20. Embedded intercept 0.695507258 + 353
   `CoefficientTraining` weights (Additional file 3), cross-verified byte-identical vs an independent
   GitHub mirror (all 353 pairs). Invariants Y=0→20 / CpGs-absent-ignored / empty-map→F⁻¹(intercept);

   from pending Epigenetics (6→5) to covered-via-concept (37→38 covered / 208→207 pending). Linked into
   the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and index (source +
   concept lines). Scope note: the Evidence unit covers ONLY the multi-tissue 353-CpG clock; the
   algorithm doc (reviewed 2026-06-23, one day later) has since extended the impl with Horvath-2018
   skin&blood (391 CpG, same anti.trafo) + Levine-2018 PhenoAge (513 CpG, NO transform) — recorded as an
   evolution, NOT a contradiction. Assumptions: table-embed assumption RESOLVED 2026-06-22
   (caller-supplied → embedded + cross-verified); no correctness gap remains. Contradictions: none.
   Follow-up: the rest of the Epigenetics family (CpG detection, methylation calling, DMRs, chromatin
   state, bisulfite) remains pending — those are distinct algorithms and will get their own concepts.

   Frommer 1992 + CalculateMethylationFromBisulfite Bismark meth/(meth+unmeth) + GenerateMethylationProfile
   Schultz 2012 weighted level). Cross-linked sibling epigenetic-age-horvath-clock (produces the β-values it

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/EPIGEN-CHROM-001-Evidence.md → epigen-chrom-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Third unit of the Epigenetics family (EPIGEN-CHROM-001) — ChromHMM-style chromatin state prediction
   from histone modification marks. Surveyed wiki/concepts: NO pre-existing chromatin / histone /
   ChromHMM concept (grep hits in epigenetic-age/centromere/log were incidental), and this is a
   genuinely-distinct algorithm from the two methylation siblings (histone ChIP-seq axis, not DNA
   methylation), so created a new anchor concept [[chromatin-state-prediction]]. Core = the ChromHMM
   binary present/absent mark model (Ernst & Kellis 2012 multivariate HMM; BinarizeBed/BinarizeBam →
   LearnModel operates on 1/0 calls; state = function of the SET of present marks, magnitude beyond the
   call irrelevant = binary invariance). `PredictChromatinState` takes the six Roadmap 18-state marks
   {H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3} as [0,1] signals, present > threshold
   (default 0.5), maps the pattern → ActivePromoter(TssA)/ActiveEnhancer/WeakEnhancer/Transcribed(Tx)/
   Repressed(ReprPC)/Heterochromatin(Het)/BivalentPromoter(TssBiv)/BivalentEnhancer(EnhBiv)/
   LowSignal(Quies). Two combinatorial rules captured: bivalency (H3K4me3+H3K27me3) is a state not a
   contradiction, and promoter(H3K4me3) dominates enhancer(H3K4me1) at one locus. Companions
   `AnnotateHistoneModifications` (per-mark region label) + `FindAccessibleRegions` (ATAC-like
   contiguous-above-threshold merge + minWidth exclusion). Sources: Ernst & Kellis 2012 (Nat Methods,
   rank-1) + ChromHMM manual (rank-3, binarization) + Roadmap Epigenomics 15/18-state definitions
   (rank-2) + six per-mark Wikipedia primaries (Liang 2004 H3K4me3 / Rada-Iglesias 2018 H3K4me1 /
   Creyghton 2010 H3K27ac / Ferrari 2014 H3K27me3 / Nicetto 2019 H3K9me3 / Kimura 2013 H3K36me3).
   Concept also lists docs/algorithms/Epigenetics/Chromatin_State_Prediction.md as a second source.
   Reconciled backlog: moved Chromatin_State_Prediction.md from pending Epigenetics (4→3) to
   covered-via-concept (39→40 covered / 206→205 pending). Cross-linked both methylation siblings
   ([[epigenetic-age-horvath-clock]], [[bisulfite-methylation-calling]]) bidirectionally; linked into
   the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + both link lists) and index (source +
   concept lines). Two assumptions: presence-threshold value 0.5 (ChromHMM uses a Poisson background
   from raw counts, not a fixed [0,1] cut — tests choose unambiguous magnitudes) and single-locus
   promoter-over-enhancer precedence (Roadmap derives it from spatial HMM context). Research-grade: the
   state-assignment logic is fully source-backed but this is NOT a trained HMM (no LearnModel / Poisson
   binarization / spatial context). Contradictions: none.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/EPIGEN-CPG-001-Evidence.md → epigen-cpg-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   FOURTH unit of the Epigenetics family (EPIGEN-CPG-001) — CpG site detection + canonical CpG
   observed/expected ratio + CpG-island detection. Surveyed wiki/concepts: NO pre-existing CpG /
   CpG-island concept (the sibling [[bisulfite-methylation-calling]] only *reuses* `FindCpGSites` inline),
   so created a genuinely-distinct anchor concept [[cpg-island-detection]] — a SEQUENCE-ONLY algorithm
   touching no methylation state, distinct from all three siblings (bisulfite measures state, Horvath clock
   scores age from β-values, chromatin works on histone marks). Three ops on `EpigeneticsAnalyzer`:
   `FindCpGSites` (linear O(n) scan, 0-based C position, adjacent `CGCG`→2 distinct sites; the same call
   [[bisulfite-methylation-calling]] reuses); `CalculateCpGObservedExpected` (Gardiner-Garden & Frommer
   O/E = CpG_count/((C·G)/L), UCSC-standard, div-by-zero guard → 0 when no C/G or L<2); `FindCpGIslands`
   (sliding-window merge, default ≥200 bp / GC ≥0.5 / O-E ≥0.6 INCLUSIVE, 0-based inclusive-Start /
   exclusive-End tuple, O(n·w) rescan). Oracles: CGCG×20→O/E 2.0, ACGTCGACG→3.0, ACGT→4.0, AT-only→0.0,
   400 bp CGCG→1 island. Corner cases: GpC≠CpG, case-insensitive uppercase-normalize, length-1→0 sites,
   zero C/G→O/E 0. Sources: Gardiner-Garden & Frommer 1987 (J Mol Biol, rank-1, canonical criteria +

   operators) + Saxonov 2006 (PNAS, rank-1, alt expected ((C+G)/2)²/L) + Wikipedia CpG site (rank-4).
   Concept also lists docs/algorithms/Epigenetics/CpG_Site_Detection.md as a second source (backlog
   reconciliation). Reconciled backlog: moved CpG_Site_Detection.md from pending Epigenetics (3→2) to
   covered-via-concept (40→41 covered / 205→204 pending); updated the index backlog-summary counts.
   Cross-linked all three Epigenetics siblings bidirectionally ([[bisulfite-methylation-calling]] tightest
   — shares `FindCpGSites`; [[epigenetic-age-horvath-clock]]; [[chromatin-state-prediction]]); linked into
   the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept list) and
   index (source + concept lines). Takai-Jones stricter + Saxonov alt-formula recorded as NOT-preset

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/EPIGEN-DMR-001-Evidence.md → epigen-dmr-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   FIFTH unit of the Epigenetics family (EPIGEN-DMR-001) — differentially methylated region (DMR)
   detection by the methylKit tiling-window + Fisher's-exact-test model. Surveyed wiki/concepts: NO
   pre-existing DMR / methylation-comparison concept, and this is a genuinely-distinct algorithm —
   it COMPARES methylation between two samples (vs the single-sample siblings), consuming the per-CpG
   C/(C+T) β-values [[bisulfite-methylation-calling]] produces over the CpGs [[cpg-island-detection]]
   locates. Created anchor concept [[differentially-methylated-regions]]. Core: fixed tiling windows
   (`win.size=1000/step.size=1000/cov.bases=0`, tileMethylCounts), meth.diff=group2%−group1%
   (percentage points), per-window pooled 2×2 methylated/unmethylated counts → Fisher's exact test
   (one sample per group; replicates→logistic regression out of scope), hypergeometric single-table p
   `(a+b)!(c+d)!(a+c)!(b+d)!/(a!b!c!d!n!)` + two-sided sum-of-≤-observed; getMethylDiff reports
   q<0.01 AND |meth.diff|>25 STRICT (hyper meth.diff>+25 / hypo <−25). Corner cases: empty→no DMRs,
   zero-coverage group / zero marginal→degenerate 2×2→p=1.0 (not reported), |meth.diff|=25→excluded.
   Oracles: Fisher single-table a=1/b=9/c=11/d=3,n=24→≈0.001346076 (Wikipedia studying-by-gender);
   hyper window g1 level 0.0/cov 20 + g2 level 1.0/cov 20 × 3 sites → pooled meth {0,60}/unmeth {60,0}
   → meth.diff +100, p≈0 (complete separation), Hypermethylated. Sources: Akalin 2012 methylKit
   (Genome Biology 13:R87, PMC3491415, rank-1/3) + tileMethylCounts/calculateDiffMeth man pages +
   get.methylDiff diffMeth.R source (rank-3) + Fisher's exact test Wikipedia citing Fisher 1922/1935
   (rank-4, primary math). Concept also lists docs/algorithms/Epigenetics/Differentially_Methylated_Regions.md
   as a second source. Reconciled backlog: moved Differentially_Methylated_Regions.md from pending
   Epigenetics (2→1) to covered-via-concept (41→42 covered / 204→203 pending); updated the index
   backlog-summary counts. Cross-linked all four Epigenetics siblings ([[bisulfite-methylation-calling]]
   tightest — DMR consumes its β-values, added reciprocal link; [[cpg-island-detection]];
   [[epigenetic-age-horvath-clock]]; [[chromatin-state-prediction]]); linked into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept list) and
   index (source + concept lines). Two evidence-backed assumptions (per-window pooling into one 2×2 =
   tileMethylCounts→Fisher documented pipeline; numC/numT=round(level×coverage) count reconstruction
   from the fractional-level MethylationSite). Research-grade: no logistic-regression replicate path /
   SLIM q-value model / overlapping-window tiling. Contradictions: none — Akalin 2012, the methylKit
   reference, and the Fisher hypergeometric definition are mutually consistent.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/EPIGEN-METHYL-001-Evidence.md → epigen-methyl-001-evidence (source) + methylation-context-classification (concept)
   Sixth and FINAL unit of the Epigenetics family — completes it. New source page epigen-methyl-001-evidence
   + new concept methylation-context-classification (CpG/CHG/CHH sequence-context classifier). Kept as its
   own concept (not folded into bisulfite): the distinct, wiki-worthy method is the IUPAC H="not G"
   trinucleotide classification of NON-CpG cytosines (CHG/CHH), which [[bisulfite-methylation-calling]]
   explicitly does not call from reads. The shared GenerateMethylationProfile (Schultz 2012 weighted level)
   is documented on bisulfite and only referenced here (no duplication). Sources: Cornish-Bowden 1985 IUPAC
   (H=A/C/T), Krueger-Andrews 2011 Bismark (CpG/CHG/CHH discrimination, CpG/CHG symmetric vs CHH asymmetric),
   Lister 2009 (non-CG mCHG/mCHH prevalence, IMR90 99.98% CG vs H1 ES ~25% non-CG), Schultz 2012 (weighted
   level). Oracles CGACAGCAA→CpG@0/CHG@3/CHH@6 + weighted (8+2)/(10+10)=0.5. Two assumptions (sequence-only
   level=0 placeholder, 0.5 MethylatedCpG count cutoff descriptive-only). Cross-linked all Epigenetics
   siblings (bisulfite tightest — added reciprocal cross-links on bisulfite's intro + not-implemented note);
   wired into algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept list)
   and index (source + concept lines). Reconciled backlog: moved Methylation_Analysis.md from pending
   Epigenetics (1→0, section removed) to covered-via-concept (42→43 covered / 203→202 pending, 34→33 domains);
   Epigenetics family now 6/6 covered. Contradictions: none — IUPAC, Bismark, Lister 2009, Schultz 2012 mutually consistent.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | GENOMIC-COMMON-001-Evidence.md → genomic-common-001-evidence (source) + longest-common-substring (concept)
   Ingested the Longest Common Substring / Common Region Detection evidence unit (generalized suffix
   tree). Created source page genomic-common-001-evidence and NEW concept longest-common-substring —
   genuinely distinct (a string/suffix-tree algorithm, no prior LCS concept). Synthesized: LCS = a
   longest *contiguous* substring of both strings (contiguity is THE distinction from the gapped
   longest common *subsequence*); generalized-suffix-tree solution (LCS = path label to the deepest
   internal node whose subtree holds leaves from both strings, Θ(n+m)/O(M+N) build+DFS, Gusfield 1997).
   API contract: FindLongestCommonRegion (0-based positions in both) + FindCommonRegions(minLength);
   CommonRegion.None = empty/len 0/positions −1, identical→whole seq at 0/0. One assumption =
   documented deterministic first-found-in-`other` tie-break (Wikipedia reports all, GeeksforGeeks
   returns one); DNA oracle CACAGAG/TACATAGAT ties ACA vs AGA → selects ACA. Sources Wikipedia
   "Longest common substring" + GeeksforGeeks "Suffix Tree Application 5". Cross-linked
   [[dot-plot-word-match]] (shared generalized-suffix-tree exact-match engine, reciprocal link added).
   Wired into algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept
   list) and index (source + concept lines). Reconciled backlog: moved Common_Region_Detection.md from
   pending Sequence_Comparison (1→0, section removed) to covered-via-concept (43→44 covered / 202→201
   pending, 33→32 domains). Contradictions: none — Wikipedia and GeeksforGeeks agree on contiguity + GST
   mechanism, differ only on reporting ties (all vs one), resolved deterministically by the repo.

   New source page [[genomic-motifs-001-evidence]] + new concept [[known-motif-search]] — the
   Motif-Analysis "Known Motif Search" unit: multi-pattern EXACT substring matching of a set of
   known query motifs (`GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif`), the exact-equality baseline distinct from motif
   discovery and degenerate (IUPAC/PROSITE/PWM) matching. THE correctness rule = all OVERLAPPING
   occurrences reported (AAA in AAAAA→{0,1,2}, per Gusfield/Tufts + Biopython `count_overlap` 3-not-2);
   API contract 0-based sorted positions, per-motif position lists (absent motifs omitted),
   upper-cased result keys, empty/whitespace motif→no entry (`Array.Empty<int>()`). Oracles: EcoRI
   GAATTC in GAATTCAAAGAATTC→{0,9}, `{ACGT,AA,TTT}` in ACGTACGTAA→{0,4}/{8}/omitted. Sources
   Tufts COMP 150GEN (Gusfield) + Biopython `Seq.search`/`count_overlap` + Wikipedia "Restriction

- 2026-07-09 — ingest `docs/Evidence/GENOMIC-ORF-001-Evidence.md` (test unit GENOMIC-ORF-001,
  Open Reading Frame detection). Created source [[genomic-orf-001-evidence]] + NEW concept
  [[open-reading-frame-detection]] (no prior ORF/gene-prediction concept existed). Algorithm =
  `GenomicAnalyzer.FindOpenReadingFrames`: six-frame ATG→first-in-frame-stop enumeration, standard
  code (start ATG / stops TAA-TAG-TGA), reported span INCLUDES the stop (Length%3==0) while the
  translated protein EXCLUDES it; THE correctness rule = every in-frame ATG reaching a stop is
  reported so nested ORFs sharing a stop are both returned (Rosalind MGMTPRLGLESLLE/MTPRLGLESLLE),
  ATG-with-no-stop→none; minLength in NUCLEOTIDES inclusive (default 100), 0-based Position / Frame
  1–3 / IsReverseComplement, INV-01..05, O(n²) worst / O(n) typical. Oracles: Rosalind_99→4 distinct
  proteins, ATGAAAAAATAA→MKK (pos 0 / frame 1). Sources Rosalind + Wikipedia + NCBI ORFfinder +
  NCBI transl_table=1. Three source-anchored assumptions (stop-inclusive span / nt minLength /
  ATG-only), deviations None (one fixed pre-existing greedy bug). Scope-disambiguated from the
  annotation-layer `GenomeAnnotator.FindOrfs` (ANNOT-ORF-001, ATG/GTG/TTG + aa-length + strand/start
  flags) and `Translator.FindOrfs` (genetic-code-parameterized) — deliberately NOT contract-equivalent.
  Wired into algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept

  from pending Analysis (2→1) to covered-via-concept (45→46 covered / 200→199 pending, 31 domains).
  Contradictions: none — Rosalind/Wikipedia/NCBI agree on six-frame ATG→stop, distinct-protein return.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/GENOMIC-REPEAT-001-Evidence.md → genomic-repeat-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
  Per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept longest-repeated-substring —
  the Repeat-Analysis LRS + all-repeats-enumeration unit (`GenomicAnalyzer.FindLongestRepeat` /
  `FindRepeats`): LRS = deepest internal node with ≥2 leaves in a *single-string* suffix tree
  (string depth = repeat length, CMU 15-451 §2.1 verbatim / Wikipedia / GeeksforGeeks App-3 /
  Gusfield 5.4 via JHU); FindRepeats enumerates every substring occurring ≥2× via sorted-suffix
  adjacent-LCP *every-prefix* expansion (O(n²), the FINDINGS_REGISTER short-prefix fix). Positioned
  as the one-string sibling of longest-common-substring (added a comparison table + reciprocal nav
  link on both pages) and explicitly distinguished from the tandem/inverted repetitive-element-detection
  anchor (§2.5 LRS-vs-FindTandemRepeats contrast). Oracles ATCGATCGA→ATCGA{0,4}, AAAAAAAAAA→AAAAAAAAA{0,1}
  overlap, ATATATA→ATATA{0,2}, ACGT/empty→None, ACGTACGTTTTTACGT@3→8-substring set. Corner cases:
  overlaps counted, minLength≤0→max(1,minLength), ACGT-only, no reverse-complement / maximal-repeat
  classification. Concise source page for the GENOMIC-REPEAT-001 artifact (four sources, LRS + brute-force
  enumeration datasets, tie-break + ascending-positions assumptions). Wired into algorithm-validation-evidence
  hub (frontmatter sources + source-list + distinct-concept list) and index (source + concept lines).
  Reconciled backlog: moved Repeat_Analysis/Repeat_Detection.md from pending Repeat_Analysis (6→5) to

  Per-algorithm Evidence file. Created the genuinely-distinct concept kmer-jaccard-similarity — the
  Analysis family's alignment-free pairwise-similarity unit (`GenomicAnalyzer.CalculateSimilarity`):
  Jaccard index `|A∩B|/|A∪B|` over the two sequences' *distinct* k-mer sets (HashSet, within-sequence
  repeats collapse), exact (no MinHash sketch) J×100 in [0,100], O(n+m). Sources: Jaccard 1901 (index
  definition, [0,1] range, non-empty-set scope, distance 1−J) + Ondov 2016 *Mash* (k-mer-set Jaccard =

  disjoint→0 / distinct-set; k=3 oracles 80.0 / 100⁄3 / 100 / 0 / (AAAAAA vs AAAA→100). Three source-backed
  assumptions (empty-union→0.0 ASM-1 convention, ×100 scaling, default k=5) + suffix-tree-evaluated-not-used
  note. Positioned as `alternative_to` the positional [[alignment-statistics]] (§2.5 set-resemblance vs
  residue-by-residue), and cross-linked (body/mentions) to the 5-mer-Jaccard metric behind
  ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits and the exact-set basis Mash sketches for average-nucleotide-identity.
  Concise source page for the artifact. Wired into index (source + concept lines). Reconciled backlog: moved
  Analysis/Sequence_Similarity.md from pending Analysis (section emptied, 1→0) to covered-via-concept

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/GENOMIC-TANDEM-001-Evidence.md → genomic-tandem-001-evidence (source) + repetitive-element-detection (concept, enriched)
  Per-algorithm Evidence file validating `GenomicAnalyzer.FindTandemRepeats` (exact tandem-repeat
  detection). REUSED the existing repeats/tandem anchor [[repetitive-element-detection]] rather than
  creating a new page — GENOMIC-TANDEM-001 is a consolidated duplicate of REP-TANDEM-001 (same method,
  same brute-force scan, canonical fixture, no new tests), and tandem detection is already sub-problem #1
  of that concept. Enriched the concept's tandem section with the two entry points over the same
  exact-copy model: `GenomicAnalyzer.FindTandemRepeats` (reports EVERY unit-length/period interpretation,
  no primitive-unit canonicalization — `AAAA` → period 1×4 AND period 2×2) vs the annotation
  `RepeatAnalyzer` path (primitive-unit rule); both exact-only, neither reports Benson TRF's approximate
  copies (Framework/Simplified limitation). Sources: Benson 1999 (Tandem Repeats Finder, period/copy-number/

## [2026-07-09] ingest | KMER-ASYNC-001-Evidence.md → kmer-async-001-evidence (source) + asynchronous-kmer-counting (concept)
   First K-mer family unit. KMER-ASYNC-001 validates the asynchronous k-mer count `KmerAnalyzer.CountKmersAsync`
   — the cooperatively cancelable, progress-reporting `Task.Run` wrapper over synchronous `CountKmers`
   (KMER-COUNT-001). Determined this is NOT a distinct counting algorithm: the numeric result is fixed by
   the k-mer formula L−k+1 and is identical to the sync reference; the uniquely validated content is the
   .NET cooperative-cancellation + progress contract (ThrowIfCancellationRequested→OperationCanceledException
   + Canceled state, pre-start Task.Run(func,token) cancellation, awaiting a canceled task throws,
   IProgress 0→1.0). No existing k-mer-counting concept to enrich (sync KMER-COUNT-001 not yet ingested), so
   created a focused concept `asynchronous-kmer-counting` (folds the execution contract + inherited count
   into one wiki-worthy page rather than a thin gotcha). Sources: Wikipedia K-mer (L−k+1 / nᵏ, ATGG→ATG+TGG,
   GTAGAGCTGT k=2/3/4 total 9/8/7 distinct 7/8/7) + Microsoft Learn Task Cancellation / Task.Run. One
   assumption = numeric contract identical to sync (non-correctness-affecting); not parallelized; suffix-tree
   evaluated-not-used. Wired into index (source + concept lines). Reconciled backlog: moved
   K-mer/Asynchronous_K-mer_Counting.md from pending K-mer (10→9) to covered-via-concept under
   [[asynchronous-kmer-counting]] (49→50 covered / 196→195 pending, 30 domains); the other 9 K-mer docs
   (incl. K-mer_Counting.md / KMER-COUNT-001) left pending. Contradictions: none (count definition and .NET
   cancellation contracts are orthogonal and mutually consistent).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | KMER-BOTH-001-Evidence.md → kmer-both-001-evidence (source) + both-strand-kmer-counting (concept)
   Second K-mer family unit. KMER-BOTH-001 validates `KmerAnalyzer.CountKmersBothStrands` — additive
   strand-aware counting. Determined this IS a genuinely distinct method (not a thin wrapper like
   KMER-ASYNC): the ADDITIVE / kPAL-"balance" convention `count[w]=forward[w]+forward[RC(w)]` (count
   k-mers of S and of RC(S), sum per key), which keeps a key per observed k-mer — explicitly NOT the
   canonical-collapsing convention (lexicographically-smaller of {w,RC(w)} as one key) of Jellyfish `-C`
   / Mash, which the algorithm does not implement. Created concept `both-strand-kmer-counting` (core
   model, INV-01..05 incl. grand-total 2·(L−k+1) / strand-symmetry / palindrome-doubling, additive-vs-
   canonical table, contract, three oracles, complexity, deviations). Sources: kPAL Methodology + Anvar
   2014 (Genome Biology 15:555, balance = sum of k-mer and its RC) + Shporer 2016 (inversion symmetry,
   grounds INV-01) + Marçais-Kingsford 2011 Jellyfish (single-strand primitive + `-C` contrast) + Mash
   issue #45 (canonical def) + Clavijo 2018 (strand rationale). Oracles ATGGC k=2→{AT:2,TG:1,GG:1,GC:2,
   CC:1,CA:1}, palindromic ACGT→{AC:2,CG:2,GT:2}, AAA→{AA:2,TT:2}. Two API-shape assumptions (empty/k>L→
   empty dict, k≤0→ArgumentOutOfRangeException inherited from CountKmers); Deviations = None. Cross-linked
   with sibling [[asynchronous-kmer-counting]] (shared sync CountKmers primitive; linked its both-strand
   mention). Concept covers the Both_Strand algorithm doc too. Wired into index (source + concept lines)
   and the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter + body source list + own-concept list; also
   back-filled the missing kmer-async-001-evidence hub-body link). Reconciled backlog: moved
   K-mer/Both_Strand_Kmer_Counting.md from pending K-mer (9→8) to covered-via-concept (50→51 covered /
   195→194 pending, 30 domains); the other 8 K-mer docs (incl. K-mer_Counting.md / KMER-COUNT-001) left
   pending. Contradictions: none — kPAL balance and inversion symmetry give identical additive semantics;
   canonical wording cited only to contrast the not-implemented collapsing mode.

   K-mer Euclidean distance (`KmerAnalyzer.KmerDistance`): alignment-free L2 distance over normalized
   k-mer FREQUENCY vectors f_s(w)=count/(L−k+1), summed over the union of observed k-mers (absent word→0
   component). Genuinely distinct from the presence/absence set measure — created a dedicated concept
   rather than enriching [[kmer-jaccard-similarity]] (Euclidean captures k-mer abundance; Jaccard does
   not), wired as `alternative_to` it. Sources Zielezinski 2017 (word-vector model, Fig.1 x=ATGTGTG/
   y=CATGTG k=3) + Lau 2022 (frequency normalization + Euclidean metric) + Vinga-Almeida 2003 (4^k vector)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | KMER-GENERATE-001-Evidence.md → kmer-generate-001-evidence (source) + k-mer-generation (concept)
   Fourth K-mer family Evidence. Test unit KMER-GENERATE-001, KmerAnalyzer.GenerateAllKmers — exhaustive
   enumeration of ALL possible k-mers of length k over an alphabet (the complete n^k universe Σ^k, 4^k for
   DNA), sequence-independent. Judged GENUINELY DISTINCT from the counting siblings → new dedicated concept
   [[k-mer-generation]] (generation = full n^k word set / frequency-array address space; counting = observed

   both-strand-kmer-counting with an inbound [[k-mer-generation]] wikilink. Concept lists both the Evidence
   file and K-mer_Generation.md algorithm doc in sources. Reconciled backlog: moved K-mer/K-mer_Generation.md

## [2026-07-09] ingest | KMER-POSITIONS-001-Evidence.md → kmer-positions-001-evidence (source) + k-mer-positions (concept)
   Fifth K-mer family Evidence. Test unit KMER-POSITIONS-001, `KmerAnalyzer.FindKmerPositions(sequence, kmer)`
   — the ascending 0-based positions where a given k-mer occurs in a sequence (a *position / occurrence
   index*: *where*, not *how many*), solving the exact Pattern Matching Problem `Occ(P,T)={i∈[0,L−k]:
   T[i..i+k)=P}` with all overlapping starts reported. Judged GENUINELY DISTINCT from the counting units
   (positions = an ordered IEnumerable<int> of offsets for one k-mer, the inverse index to the
   Dictionary<string,int> count table) → new dedicated concept [[k-mer-positions]] rather than enriching a
   counting concept. Positioned as the single-pattern K-mer-family sibling of the multi-pattern exact
   matcher [[known-motif-search]] (`GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif`) — same 0-based ascending all-overlapping
   semantics, one list vs a per-motif map. Sources: Rosalind BA1D (binding 0-based worked example ATAT/

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/KMER-STATS-001-Evidence.md → kmer-stats-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Sixth K-mer family Evidence file (after ASYNC, BOTH, DIST, GENERATE, POSITIONS). Judged
   `KmerAnalyzer.AnalyzeKmers` a GENUINELY DISTINCT companion summary layer over the shared CountKmers
   multiset — it reduces the count profile to a KmerStatistics bundle {TotalKmers, UniqueKmers, MaxCount,
   MinCount, AverageCount, Entropy} and adds the one formula unique to this unit, the Shannon **k-entropy**
   `E_k=−Σ p(α)log₂p(α)`, `p(α)=mult/(L−k+1)` (Manca 2021 arXiv:2106.15351 + Entropy–Rank Ratio
   arXiv:2511.05300), so it warrants its own concept rather than enriching a counting concept. Created
   concept [[k-mer-statistics]]. Captured the naming GOTCHA: `UniqueKmers` holds the **distinct** count
   (each different k-mer once), NOT the count==1 singletons (that is the separate KMER-UNIQUE-001 /
   Unique_And_MinCount_Kmers.md unit). Count facts (TotalKmers=L−k+1, distinct) from Wikipedia + BioInfoLogics
   count tables; AverageCount=total/distinct. Oracles GTAGAGCTGT k=1 (10/4/max4(G)/min1(C)/avg2.5/H1.846439…) +

   k≤0→ArgumentOutOfRangeException, case-insensitive. Two presentation-only assumptions (AverageCount rounded
   2dp via Math.Round; Entropy unrounded bits, tests within 1e-10), neither correctness-affecting. Concise
   source page for the artifact; concept lists both the Evidence file and K-mer_Statistics.md algorithm doc in
   sources. Wired into index (source + concept lines) + the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter
   source + body evidence-link + own-concept list). Reconciled backlog: moved K-mer/K-mer_Statistics.md from
   pending K-mer (5→4) to covered-via-concept (54→55 covered / 191→190 pending, 30 domains). Contradictions:

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/KMER-UNIQUE-001-Evidence.md → kmer-unique-001-evidence (source) + unique-and-mincount-kmers (concept)
   Seventh K-mer family Evidence file (after ASYNC, BOTH, DIST, GENERATE, POSITIONS, STATS). Judged
   `KmerAnalyzer.FindUniqueKmers` + `FindKmersWithMinCount` a GENUINELY DISTINCT frequency-filtering
   unit — confirmed by the prior KMER-STATS-001 flag that "unique" (count==1 singletons) is THIS unit,
   separate from k-mer-statistics' `UniqueKmers`=distinct-count field. Created concept
   [[unique-and-mincount-kmers]] (expected backlog slug). Two operations filter the shared CountKmers
   multiset by per-k-mer Count at opposite ends of the distribution: FindUniqueKmers = Count==1
   singletons, FindKmersWithMinCount = Count≥minCount recurrent k-mers ordered by count desc. Captured
   the total/distinct/unique terminology (BioInfoLogics: unique="appear only once") and the reciprocal
   GOTCHA against [[k-mer-statistics]] (ATCGATCAC k=3 → 5 unique singletons vs 6 distinct; ATC=2
   excluded), surgically enriching the k-mer-statistics gotcha to link the new concept. Sources:
   Wikipedia K-mer (L−k+1 total, AGAT) + BioInfoLogics (distinct/unique, ATCGATCAC 7/6/5) + Compeau &
   Pevzner (`Count(Text,Pattern)`, most-frequent / Count≥t recurrent). Oracles ATCGATCAC k=3→{TCG,CGA,

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/META-ALPHA-001-Evidence.md → meta-alpha-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   First per-algorithm Evidence file from the Metagenomics domain (new topic area — confirmed no
   existing metagenomics/diversity concept). Created the genuinely-distinct concept alpha-diversity —
   the anchor for the Metagenomics diversity family: within-sample diversity indices from one
   taxon→abundance map via `MetagenomicsAnalyzer.CalculateAlphaDiversity` → `AlphaDiversity` record with
   six fields. Formulas traced verbatim to the primary literature: observed richness S_obs=|{pᵢ>0}|,
   Shannon H=−Σpᵢln(pᵢ) using Math.Log (nats) per Shannon 1948, Simpson concentration λ=Σpᵢ² per Simpson
   1949, inverse Simpson 1/λ = Hill order-2 effective species per Hill 1973, Pielou evenness J=H/ln(S)
   for S>1 else 0 (standard ecological convention, ln(1)=0) per Pielou 1966, Chao1 S_obs+f₁²/(2f₂) with
   the f₂=0 bias-corrected branch S_obs+f₁(f₁−1)/2 per Chao 1984; Whittaker 1960 α/β/γ framing.
   Counts-or-proportions accepted (positive values internally normalized to sum 1), non-positive
   filtered (ln(0) undefined), O(n). INV-01..05 + empty/null→all-0 + single-species H0/λ1/J0 corner
   cases; oracles single→H0/λ1, (0.5,0.5)→ln2/0.5/2/J1, 4-equal→ln4/0.25/4/J1, (0.9,0.1)→H0.325/J0.469.
   FLAGGED NUANCE (not a contradiction): the Evidence file says "Deviations: None — all formulas match
   exactly", while the algorithm doc §5.4 records one accepted deviation — Chao1 falls back to
   ObservedSpecies for non-integer/proportional abundance input (data-type gate, not a formula change);
   captured on both the source and concept pages as consistent. Concise source page (Wikipedia
   Diversity-index/Alpha-diversity/Species-richness/Species-evenness + Shannon/Simpson/Hill/Chao/Pielou
   primaries). Wired into index (source + concept lines) + the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   (frontmatter source + body evidence-link + own-concept list). Reconciled backlog: moved
   Metagenomics/Alpha_Diversity.md from pending Metagenomics (10→9) to covered-via-concept (56→57
   covered / 189→188 pending, 30 domains). Cross-linked [[beta-diversity]] as a not-yet-created future

   sibling) + [[meta-beta-001-evidence]] source page. Wired into index (source + concept lines) + the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source + body evidence-link + own-concept list).
   Cross-linked reciprocally with [[alpha-diversity]] (within- vs between-sample halves of Whittaker's
   framework; added a relates_to edge on each). Noted ecological-Jaccard shares the index math but not
   the domain with sequence [[kmer-jaccard-similarity]] (prose mention only, no typed edge). Reconciled

   None). Cross-linked as Metagenomics-family sibling of [[alpha-diversity]]/[[beta-diversity]] in prose
   (different question — genome reconstruction vs community diversity — so no typed sibling edge, source

   ADDENDUM to META-BIN-001 — validates the CheckM-style single-copy marker-gene completeness/
   contamination now built on top of the TNF/coverage binning. Created source page
   [[meta-bin-001-markerqc-evidence]]. ENRICHED the existing [[metagenomic-binning]] concept rather
   than creating a new one (the marker QC is the quality-metric layer of binning, not a separate
   wiki-worthy algorithm): rewrote the proxy-vs-CheckM GOTCHA (the residual is now BUILT but exposed
   through a distinct opt-in API `EstimateBinQualityFromMarkerCounts`/`EstimateBinQualityFromMarkers`/
   `DetectMarkers`, NOT wired into `BinContigs`, whose fields stay length-ratio/GC-variance proxies);
   added a Marker-gene QC section (CheckM Eqs. 1–2 over collocated sets `M`, multi-copy counts once
   toward present + N−1 toward contamination; bundled CC0 Pfam sets = 9 ribosomal + bac120 6 + ar122

   the concept frontmatter. Added a forward-pointer on the base [[meta-bin-001-evidence]] source page
   (its "honest residual" note now flags the addendum built it). Wired into index (new source line +
   refreshed the metagenomic-binning concept summary). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] frontmatter
   NOT edited — its per-file list drifted (base META-BIN/META-BETA absent too); the source page links
   the hub in prose (mention edge). Backlog: no change — base Genome_Binning.md already covered-via-
   concept, the addendum has no separate docs/algorithms doc. Contradictions: none (the addendum
   supersedes the base file's "not implemented" residual; recorded as an evolution, not a conflict).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/META-PATHWAY-001-Evidence.md → meta-pathway-001-evidence (source) + pathway-enrichment-ora (concept)
   Sixth Metagenomics-family Evidence unit and the DEDICATED unit for the ORA / hypergeometric machinery
   that META-FUNC-001 exercised as component B. DECISION: created a focused new concept
   [[pathway-enrichment-ora]] that OWNS the method (rather than only enriching [[functional-prediction]]) —
   the evidence is substantial enough to stand alone: its own GO::TermFinder (Boyle 2004) + PNNL ORA §8.2
   sources, the M↔n symmetry invariant, and exact hand-derived rational oracles. The concept synthesizes
   the hypergeometric right-tail `P(X≥x)=1−Σ_{i=0}^{x−1}C(M,i)C(N−M,n−i)/C(N,n)` (`phyper(x−1,M,N−M,n,
   lower.tail=FALSE)`, N=background/M=pathway/n=query/x=overlap, upper-tail/without-replacement), log-Gamma
   summation to N=8000, p∈[0,1], sorted ascending; p=1 when x/M/n=0; background = explicit else

   PNNL N8000/M100/n400/x20→7.88e−8 + exact 1/252 / 5/6 / 1 / 251/252. Created source page
   [[meta-pathway-001-evidence]]. Reciprocally cross-linked with [[functional-prediction]]: rewrote its
   component-B blockquote to defer ownership here (was "not yet ingested / may get its own page") and added
   a typed edge functional-prediction relates_to pathway-enrichment-ora; also updated the
   [[meta-func-001-evidence]] source page's scope note ("now ingested"). Hub
   [[algorithm-validation-evidence]]: added META-PATHWAY to frontmatter sources (bumped source_commit to
   HEAD 14005a6) + source-list + concept-list. index.md: +1 source +1 concept, refreshed the
   functional-prediction / meta-func lines. Backlog: moved Metagenomics/Pathway_Enrichment_ORA.md
   pending→covered (61→62 covered / 184→183 pending; §Metagenomics 5→4). Contradictions: none — Boyle 2004
   and PNNL §8.2 give the identical right-tail formula; the background-defaulting assumption is
   formula-preserving and caller-overridable. Note: the ORA statistic is generic (GO/proteomics sources)
   though registered under metagenomics via `FindPathwayEnrichment`.

   Seventh ingested Metagenomics-family Evidence file (META-PROF-001). Decision: created the
   genuinely-distinct concept [[taxonomic-profile]] rather than enriching [[taxonomic-classification]] —
   profiling is the aggregation/estimation step the classification unit explicitly deferred, with its own
   method `MetagenomicsAnalyzer.GenerateTaxonomicProfile(IEnumerable<TaxonomicClassification>)` producing a
   `TaxonomicProfile` (relative-abundance maps at four ranks kingdom/phylum/genus/species = count(taxon)/
   Σcount(classified), inline species-level Shannon H=−Σpᵢln(pᵢ) nats + Simpson concentration λ=Σpᵢ², and
   TotalReads/ClassifiedReads). Counting rules: Unclassified excluded from denominators, empty rank strings
   filtered, per-rank Σ≈1.0. Invariants ClassifiedReads≤TotalReads / =Σ(counts any rank) / Shannon≥0 /

   Metagenomics + Relative-abundance-distribution + MetaPhlAn docs + Segata 2012 (Nature Methods). Created
   source page [[meta-prof-001-evidence]]. Cross-linked reciprocally: rewrote taxonomic-classification's
   deferred-profiling sentence to point at [[taxonomic-profile]] ("not yet ingested"→link + input-shape).

   Metagenomics/Taxonomic_Profile.md pending→covered (62→63 covered / 183→182 pending; §Metagenomics 4→3).
   Contradictions: none — the verified design decisions (nats log, concentration-index λ, empty→0) are
   mathematical facts, no literature deviations. Scope note: count-based tally, NOT MetaPhlAn marker-gene
   coverage estimation; no genome-size/copy-number correction; inherits upstream classifier accuracy.

   community **differential abundance** via the per-taxon two-group **Mann–Whitney U / Wilcoxon rank-sum**
   test is a distinct *statistical test* from the hypergeometric [[pathway-enrichment-ora]] and the
   Fisher's-exact [[differentially-methylated-regions]] (cross-linked as alternatives-by-test). Two methods

  ResFinder-style screen of assembled contigs vs a CALLER-SUPPLIED resistance-gene reference DB
  (curated CARD/ResFinder tables not embedded). Private `BestUngappedMatch` slides each reference
  across the contig at every offset −(m−1)..n−1 (overhanging both ends so contig-edge/split genes
  score against the reference length), keeps the max-match window (tie→shorter=higher identity),
  then identity=matches/w (BLAST gapless denominator, Heng Li 2018) & coverage=w/m (fraction of
  REFERENCE length); reports the reference iff identity≥idThreshold AND coverage≥covThreshold;
  best-matching gene per contig = max identity, tie→max coverage (Zankari 2012 "best-matching
  gene"; CARD RGI best-hit by bit score). INV-01..05; defaults 0.90 ID / 0.60 cov named constants;

  = antiparallel RNA reverse complement for seed→target motif (Lewis 2005; let-7a `GAGGUAG`→

  stacking sum over consecutive paired runs (sign reliable — fully-WC ≤0, all-mismatch ≥0 —
  magnitude NOT). Oracles AAAA/UUUU→4 matches, GGGG/UUUU→4 wobbles, AAAA/AAAA→4 mismatches. Made the
  concept the **shared base-pairing primitive** anchor (per ingest brief: Watson-Crick/G-U wobble is
  a primitive both RNA-structure and miRNA use) — documented so a future RnaStructure

  method — precursor stem-loop hairpin detection, not the miRNA-target duplex of [[rna-base-pairing]]).
  Algorithm = `MiRnaAnalyzer`: DEFAULT heuristic `FindPreMiRnaHairpins` counts uninterrupted
  complementary pairs ({A-U,G-C}+G-U wobble — the [[rna-base-pairing]] primitive) from both ends

  star(3' arm), balanced dot-bracket, Turner-2004 ΔG (stacking+loop+terminal-mismatch+0.45 AU/GU).
  DOCUMENTED LIMITATION (accepted, not a bug): consecutive-pairing is stricter than real structure →
  rejects natural miRBase precursors (hsa-mir-21 16 end-pairs, let-7a-1 5, tests M18/M19). Three
  OPT-IN production paths (default unchanged): (1) `AssessHairpinByMfe`/`FindPreMiRnaHairpinsByMfe`
  fold via the RNA-STRUCT-001 Zuker–Stiegler engine and read the hairpin from the real MFE structure
  (single dominant hairpin/no multibranch + stem bp ≥16 (Ambros 2003) + loop 3-25 + MFEI ≥0.85 (Zhang
  2006, AMFE=100·|ΔG°|/n, MFEI=AMFE/GC%)) → detects hsa-mir-21 (ΔG° −35.13/32 bp/MFEI 1.0037) &
  let-7a-1 (ΔG° −34.31/MFEI 1.0091) the heuristic rejects; a 120-nt multibranch 5S-rRNA-like fold is
  REJECTED on STRUCTURE (multibranch, not a single dominant hairpin) despite a strongly negative

   DNA sequence, count overlapping occurrences, rank by observed/expected enrichment
   `Count / ((N−k+1)/4^k)` under a zero-order i.i.d. uniform background (Compeau & Pevzner);
   deterministic exact single-pass hash-map, 0-based positions. Distinct from the sibling motif
   concepts by *question asked*: it finds UNKNOWN over-represented words (motif = output) whereas
   [[known-motif-search]] matches a supplied set of KNOWN motifs (motif = input) — modelled
   `alternative_to` it — and [[consensus-from-alignment]] collapses an already-aligned instance
   set. Oracles: `ATGC` in `ATGCATGCATGC` k=4 → Count 3 @ {0,4,8}, E=9/256, enrichment 768/9≈85.333;
   `AAA` in `AAAAAAAAAA` k=3 → Count 8, E=0.125, enrichment 64.0. Corner cases k>N→empty, null→
   ArgumentNullException, k<1→ArgumentOutOfRangeException. One assumption: minCount (default 2) is a
   presentation threshold, not correctness-affecting (O/E defined for every k-mer). Intentional
   simplifications (not deviations): zero-order uniform background only (no higher-order Markov, so
   O/E can over/under-state on biased sequences), no closed-form p-value/E-value (self-overlap
   approximation affects only the probability statistic, not Count/E). Sources: Compeau & Pevzner
   *Bioinformatics Algorithms* Ch.2 (wikiselev wiki, rank 1) + monaLisa `getKmerFreq`/PeerJ O/E-ratio
   corroboration (rank 3). Linked new source + concept into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub
   (added MOTIF-DISCOVER to frontmatter sources + source-list + concept-list) and cross-linked both
   sibling motif concepts (known-motif-search, consensus-from-alignment) to it. index.md: +1 source
   +1 concept. Backlog: moved Motif_Discovery/Overrepresented_Kmer_Discovery.md pending→covered
   (70→71 covered / 175→174 pending; §Motif_Discovery 3→2, domains still 29). Contradictions: none.
   Follow-up: remaining Motif_Discovery units (Regulatory_Elements, Shared_Motifs / FindSharedMotifs)
   warrant their own pages when ingested; other de novo families (greedy/median-string/Gibbs) not
   implemented.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | MOTIF-GENERATE-001-Evidence.md → motif-generate-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   IUPAC-Degenerate Consensus Generation (MotifFinder.GenerateConsensus): per-column keep every
   base with count > 0.25·n (strict >) → NC-IUB 1984 IUPAC symbol for that base set; no-pass
   fallback → most-frequent (alphabetical tie). Created concept iupac-degenerate-consensus and
   cross-linked the plurality [[consensus-from-alignment]] (str_replace: named GenerateConsensus
   as MOTIF-GENERATE-001 with a wikilink) and the exact [[known-motif-search]] / de-novo
   [[overrepresented-kmer-discovery]] siblings. index.md: +1 source +1 concept. Backlog: moved
   Pattern_Matching/IUPAC_Degenerate_Consensus.md pending→covered (71→72 covered / 174→173

## [2026-07-09] ingest | MOTIF-REGULATORY-001-Evidence.md → motif-regulatory-001-evidence (source) + regulatory-element-detection (concept)
   Ingested the Regulatory-Elements evidence unit: scanning a DNA sequence against a curated
   `KnownMotifs` catalog of 12 canonical regulatory consensus strings (TATA/−10/−35/CAAT/GC
   promoter boxes, Kozak + Shine-Dalgarno translation signals, poly(A), E-box/AP-1/NF-κB/CREB
   TF sites), each source-anchored to its primary literature; reports Name/Pattern/Sequence per
   occurrence at 0-based start, mixes exact + one IUPAC-degenerate (E-box `CANNTG`) match.
   Decision: created a DEDICATED concept [[regulatory-element-detection]] rather than enriching
   [[known-motif-search]] — the unit's correctness is its *cited catalog of named biological
   elements* (incl. the AP-1 `TGAGTCA`→`TGACTCA` corrected-defect regression), a fixed-catalog
   specialization of the generic caller-supplied exact scan. Cross-linked as the canonical-catalog
   sibling of [[known-motif-search]] and the matching-in-practice counterpart of the generation
   [[iupac-degenerate-consensus]] (both concept pages updated with back-links). index.md: +1
   source +1 concept. Backlog: moved Motif_Discovery/Regulatory_Elements.md pending→covered
   (72→73 covered / 173→172 pending; §Motif_Discovery 2→1, domains still 29). Contradictions: none
   (two source-backed representative-site assumptions: NF-κB strong site `GGGACTTTCC`, Kozak exact
   `GCCGCCACCATGG`). Follow-up: distinct promoter-detection unit (Annotation/Promoter_Detection.md)
   + Motif_Discovery/Shared_Motifs.md still pending.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | MOTIF-SHARED-001-Evidence.md → motif-shared-001-evidence (source) + shared-motifs (concept)
   Shared motifs across a sequence set (`FindSharedMotifs`): the van Helden / RSAT oligo-analysis
   **"matching sequences"** quorum — enumerate every fixed-`k` exact word across a *set* of sequences
   and report each word present in ≥ `minSequences` of them, keyed by presence/absence per sequence
   (a within-sequence repeat contributes 1, not its occurrence multiplicity), each carrying its
   `SequenceIndices` set + `Prevalence`=matching/total. Decision: created a DEDICATED concept
   [[shared-motifs]] rather than enriching [[longest-common-substring]] — the source explicitly
   contrasts this fixed-k + quorum + ALL-qualifying-words method against the ROSALIND LCSM framing
   (variable-length single longest substring present in *all*, via generalized suffix tree), which it
   does NOT implement. Modeled as `alternative_to` [[longest-common-substring]] (the k-string quorum
   vs single-longest-in-all pair) and `relates_to` [[overrepresented-kmer-discovery]] (same van Helden
   word-enumeration family: cross-sequence quorum vs single-sequence O/E enrichment). Cross-linked both
   ways: enriched overrepresented-kmer-discovery (wikilinked its FindSharedMotifs mention) and
   longest-common-substring (added a many-string-relative nav paragraph). Oracle: S0=`ATGATG`/
   S1=`ATGCCC`/S2=`CCCGGG`, k=3 minSeq=2 → `ATG`{0,1}(2/3)/`CCC`{1,2}; Rosalind GATTACA/TAGACCA/ATACA
   contrast (all-2-mers-in-all vs single LCSM `AC`). Corner cases: within-seq repeat→1, below-quorum
   excluded, k>shortest→no words, empty→none, k<1→throws; exact-word only (Das & Dai "no variations").
   Sources: RSAT oligo-analysis manual (rank 3, reference impl — verbatim matching-sequences/occurrence
   defs) + Das & Dai 2007 (rank 1, word-enumeration family) + van Helden/André/Collado-Vides 1998 (rank
   1 primary, HTTP 403) + Rosalind LCSM (rank 4, contrast-only). Linked new source + concept into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (added MOTIF-SHARED to frontmatter sources + source-list +
   concept-list). index.md: +1 source +1 concept. Backlog: moved Motif_Discovery/Shared_Motifs.md
   pending→covered (73→74 covered / 172→171 pending; §Motif_Discovery removed, domains 29→28).
   Contradictions: none; deviations None — two presentation/API assumptions (default k=6/minSeq=2,
   Prevalence as fraction). Follow-up: ProteinMotif/Common_Motif_Finding + Motif_Search still pending
   (protein-side motif family).
   graph: +2 nodes (source + concept), +3 typed edges (shared-motifs relates_to test-unit-registry +

## [2026-07-09] lint | structural + graph + semantic pass (172 pages)
Structural: 2 orphans → 1 fixed (mutation-testing now linked from [[validation-and-testing]] and
[[mutation-testing-analysis]]); backlog orphan is intentional (index). Broken wikilink fixed
(methylation-context-classification anchored link to bisulfite-methylation-calling — the lint resolver
does not support `#anchor` syntax, so dropped to a plain link + prose section reference). Oversize:
backlog.md 453 lines (soft cap only, working coverage tracker — left as-is). Stale: none.
Graph: 1 broken source ref fixed by creating the missing companion source page
[[mutation-testing-analysis]] for docs/Evidence/MUTATION-TESTING-ANALYSIS.md (the mutation-testing
concept had been ingested without it); edge source: mutation-testing-analysis now resolves.
Graph re-extracted: +2 nodes, +12 edges; graph lint clean.
Coverage: 324 uncovered under docs/** (172 algorithms tracked in backlog + 132 Evidence = active
per-unit campaign + 10 checklists + others) — not triaged item-by-item (that many is the "lint report
too long" signal; see recommendations). No source contradictions found in the semantic pass over the
recently-updated motif/epigenetics/testing pages.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/checklists/*.md → 10 testing-methodology checklists (9 concepts + 10 sources)
Ingested the full 10-doc testing-methodology family as a coherent batch. New concepts:
[[property-based-testing]], [[metamorphic-testing]], [[fuzzing]], [[snapshot-testing]],
[[algebraic-testing]], [[architecture-testing]], [[differential-testing]],
[[combinatorial-testing]], [[characterization-testing]] (mutation already had [[mutation-testing]],
now enriched with the checklist end-state). New source pages: one per checklist
(*-checklist slugs). Wired all nine concepts + mutation into the [[validation-and-testing]] hub
bullet list (each now links its concept + P0–P3 priority) and refreshed the coverage paragraph:
per-checklist end-state (property/metamorphic/fuzzing 258/258, architecture 22/22, combinatorial
193, mutation all-files-≥80% by 2026-06-30, algebraic 89+169-N/A, differential 107) supersedes the
older "only architecture complete" 2026-03-19 baseline — a temporal progression, no contradiction.
Real remaining gap: snapshot 37/255 + on-demand characterization. Semantic note recorded on
[[mutation-testing]]: the [[mutation-testing-analysis]] 60.6% baseline (2026-02-14) and the
[[mutation-testing-checklist]] ≥80% end-state (2026-06-30) are two points in time, not a conflict.
graph: +21 nodes, +126 edges (10 typed relates_to edges to validation-and-testing/property-based/
layered-architecture/snapshot; rest are body-wikilink mentions); graph lint clean. index updated
(10 sources + 9 concepts). Wiki now 191 pages.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ONCO-ACTION-001-Evidence.md → clinical actionability (OncoKB levels)
First Oncology-family unit. New source page [[onco-action-001-evidence]] and new anchor concept
[[clinical-actionability-oncokb-levels]] (Clinical Actionability Assessment by the OncoKB Therapeutic
Levels of Evidence). The algorithm is a pure level-ranking of caller-supplied leveled drug associations
under the fixed combined order R1 > 1 > 2 > 3A > 3B > 4 > R2 (sensitivity axis 1 > 2 > 3A > 3B > 4,
resistance axis R1 > R2), reporting the max per axis + combined, or NotActionable when a variant carries
no leveled association. Genuinely distinct from all existing concepts (no oncology page existed) →
warranted its own concept, wired into the [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] hub (frontmatter source +
evidence link + anchor bullet). Sources: Chakravarty 2017 OncoKB (JCO PO, DOI paywalled) + OncoKB
Levels-of-Evidence PDF V2 + OncoKB Curation SOP v3 + oncokb-annotator README — all mutually consistent
(SOP explicitly consistent with AMP/ASCO/CAP Li 2017). Two assumptions: NotActionable is the library's
name for OncoKB's empty-HIGHEST_LEVEL observable; the knowledgebase is a caller input (library ranks,
does not embed the OncoKB DB). No contradictions. index updated (1 source + 1 concept).
graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to → test-unit-registry on the concept); graph lint clean.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ONCO-ANNOT-001-Evidence.md → onco-annot-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Second Oncology unit: Cancer-Specific Variant Annotation by the AMP/ASCO/CAP 2017 four-tier
   clinical-significance classification (AnnotateCancerVariants + GetCOSMICAnnotation). Created concept
   cancer-variant-tier-classification-amp-asco-cap (decision rule: evidence level A/B→Tier I, C/D→Tier II,
   no-level+MAF≥1%-or-no-assoc→Tier IV, no-level+rare+assoc→Tier III; 1% primary benign cutoff inclusive;
   evidence level dominates frequency; GetCOSMICAnnotation = null-on-miss caller-supplied catalog lookup).
   Sources: Li MM et al. 2017 (J Mol Diagn, four-tier consensus, Figure 2 / Tables 3-7) + Tate JG et al.
   2019 (COSMIC external DB) — mutually consistent. Cross-linked as the sibling of, and consistent with,
   clinical-actionability-oncokb-levels (OncoKB levels). Two assumptions (caller-supplied evidence inputs;
   III/IV discriminator = direct Figure 2/Table 6-7 reading). No contradictions. index + hub updated
   (1 source + 1 concept).
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to → test-unit-registry, relates_to → clinical-actionability-oncokb-levels on the concept); graph lint clean.

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ONCO-ARTIFACT-001-Evidence.md → onco-artifact-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Third Oncology unit: Sequencing Artifact Detection (FilterArtifacts) — OxoG / FFPE deamination
   substitution classification + strand-orientation bias. Created concept sequencing-artifact-detection,
   deliberately framed as the QC sibling of the two clinical-significance ONCO units (it removes
   false-positive somatic calls from DNA damage / mapping bias BEFORE clinical interpretation, rather than
   judging significance). Three disjoint signals: (1) substitution-class — OxoG oxidation G>T(R1)/C>A(R2)
   [Chen 2017] vs FFPE cytosine-deamination C>T/G>A [Do & Dobrovic 2015], else not-an-artifact; (2) GIV
   (Global Imbalance Value) = per-substitution R1/R2 count ratio (GIV_G_T = count(G>T in R1)/count(G>T in
   R2)), neutral 1 / damaged > 1.5 [Chen 2017 + Ettwiller Damage-estimator]; (3) FisherStrand FS =
   -10*log10(two-sided Fisher-exact p) on the [ref_fwd,ref_rev,alt_fwd,alt_rev] 2x2 table, MIN_PVALUE
   1e-320 [GATK]. Oracles: GIV 200/100->2.0 & balanced->1.0; FS [10,10,10,10]->0.0 & [20,0,0,20]->large;
   class table G>T/C>A->OxoG, C>T/G>A->FFPE, A>G->neither. Result subset of input. Two assumptions:
   no BAM parser (per-strand/read-mate evidence passed on the variant record, API-shape only); GIV 1/1.5
   thresholds verbatim from the Nature Methods summary of Chen 2017. No source contradictions — the four
   sources each cover a disjoint signal and are mutually consistent. Wired into algorithm-validation-evidence
   hub (frontmatter source + evidence link + anchor bullet); index updated (1 source + 1 concept).
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to → test-unit-registry on the concept)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ONCO-ASCAT-001-Evidence.md → onco-ascat-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fourth Oncology unit: allele-specific copy number + joint tumor purity/ploidy fit — the upstream
   copy-number layer beneath the three clinical-interpretation ONCO units. New concept
   allele-specific-copy-number-ascat spanning FOUR disjoint algorithm stages with disjoint primary
   literature: (1) ASCAT core (Van Loo 2010 PNAS + ascat.runAscat.R) — nA/nB inversion from per-locus
   logR r + BAF b, joint (ρ,ψ) grid search minimising length-weighted squared minor-allele distance to
   non-negative integers (BAF=0.5 down-weighted x0.05), GoF=(1−d/TheoretMaxdist)*100, round+clamp-0,
   major=larger, γ=1 for sequencing (0.55 arrays only); (2) ASPCF segmentation (Nilsen 2012 PCF
   `Σ(y−ȳ)²+γ|S|` O(n²) DP e_k=min_j(d_jk+e_{j−1}+γ) + Ross 2021 joint common-breakpoint separate-means
   + BAF mirroring); (3) subclonal two-state Battenberg (Nik-Zainal 2012) n_obs=f·n₁+(1−f)·n₂ over
   bracketing integers ⌊⌋/⌈⌉, integer→single clonal state; (4) multiplicity/CCF (McGranahan 2016 /
   PICTograph VAF=(m·CCF·p)/(c·p+2(1−p)) / DeCiFering c=(F·v)/(ρ·M)), clamp m to [1,major-CN]. Planted
   oracles invert the forward model: ρ₀=0.80, ψ₀∈{2,3}, segments 1+1/2+0(CN-LOH)/2+1, clonal CCF≈1.0;
   ASPCF two-level track γ=0.5→1 breakpoint; subclonal 1.4/0.6→states (2,0)/(1,1) f≈0.4. Four
   synthesis-only/scope assumptions (het-SNP BAF forward model + avg-ploidy logR normalisation used only
   to synthesise inputs; γ exposed not hard-coded; two-state uses bracketing integers, ≥3 populations
   out of scope). Genuinely distinct from the total-CN chromosome-arm aneuploidy-detection (no allelic
   contrast/purity) — cross-linked as its allele-specific counterpart. No source contradictions (four
   disjoint stages). Wired into algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source + evidence link +
   anchor bullet); index updated (1 source + 1 concept).
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to → test-unit-registry on the concept)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | docs/Evidence/ONCO-CCF-001-Evidence.md → onco-ccf-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Fifth Oncology unit: cancer cell fraction (CCF) estimation + 1D clonal/subclonal clustering — the
   downstream clonal-structure layer above the ASCAT copy-number substrate. The CCF point formula is
   already carried by allele-specific-copy-number-ascat §4, so this reuses/cross-links ASCAT for it; the
   genuinely distinct, wiki-worthy content is the standalone EstimateCCF with the reported-value [0,1]
   cap (exposing uncapped raw — CNAqc 1.06 noise case) and ClusterCCFValues, a deterministic 1D Lloyd
   k-means (quantile seeding, no RNG) that deconvolutes the CCF vector into clones/subclones with the
   highest-centroid = clonal rule (Tarabichi 2021). New concept cancer-cell-fraction-clonal-clustering.
   Sources corroborate the CCF closed form three ways (Tarabichi 2021 Nat. Methods / Zheng 2022
   PICTograph / McGranahan 2016 Science) + CNAqc (CCF>1 from noise) + Lloyd 1982. Two source-consistent
   assumptions ([0,1] cap via invariant + McGranahan clonal definition; Lloyd k-means as the concrete 1D
   method — sources name clustering only broadly). No contradictions. Enriched ASCAT §4 with a forward
   cross-link to the clustering concept; wired into algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter
   source + evidence link + anchor bullet); index updated (1 source + 1 concept).
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to → test-unit-registry, depends_on → allele-specific-copy-number-ascat, on the concept)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | ONCO-CHIP-001-Evidence.md → onco-chip-001-evidence (source) + clonal-hematopoiesis-cfdna-filtering (concept)
   Sixth Oncology unit: clonal-hematopoiesis (CHIP) filtering for cfDNA liquid biopsy — the pre-interpretation
   biological-origin filter. Sources Steensma 2015 (CHIP def: VAF ≥ 2% + driver gene + no malignancy) + Genovese
   2014 (recurrent CH genes) + Razavi 2019 (CH = dominant cfDNA confounder 81.6%/53.2%, matched-WBC = definitive
   origin test) + Arango-Argoty 2025 (gold standard) + Bolton 2020 (strict origin: WBC VAF ≥ 2% AND ≥ 10 reads
   AND ≥ φ× tumour VAF, φ=2.0 / 1.5 lymph node). Three methods IdentifyCHIPVariants / FilterCHIP (matched-WBC +
   conservative gene+VAF fallback) / CallVariantOrigin. Two source-consistent assumptions (canonical default gene
   set, ≥1-alt-read WBC presence test); no contradictions. New concept cross-linked as the biological-origin
   sibling of sequencing-artifact-detection (reciprocal body link added there); wired into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source + evidence link + anchor bullet); index updated (1 source
   + 1 concept).
   graph: +2 nodes, +2 typed edges (relates_to → test-unit-registry, relates_to → sequencing-artifact-detection, on the concept)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | ONCO-CLONAL-001-Evidence.md → onco-clonal-001-evidence (source) + clonal-subclonal-classification-ccf-posterior (concept)
   Seventh Oncology unit: clonal vs subclonal mutation classification via a Bayesian CCF posterior — the
   probabilistic clonal-structure classifier. Sources Landau 2013 Cell (ABSOLUTE-style expected allele fraction
   f(c)=αc/(2(1−α)+αq), posterior P(c)∝Binom(a|N,f(c)) uniform prior on 100-point grid c∈[0.01,1], rule clonal iff
   P(CCF>0.95)>0.5) + Satas 2021 Cell Systems DeCiFering (multiplicity-general f(c)=αMc/(2(1−α)+αq), Eq. 1). Grid
   oracles A1/B2/E clonal, C1/D subclonal, E the M=2 multiplicity lift; point-estimate IdentifyClonalMutations
   strict CCF>0.95 → indices {0,2,4}. One API-shape assumption (per-variant local copy number q over a genome-wide
   ploidy scalar), no source contradictions. Judged genuinely DISTINCT from ONCO-CCF-001 (point estimate + Lloyd
   k-means clustering): new concept created and cross-linked alternative_to cancer-cell-fraction-clonal-clustering
   (reciprocal body link added there); wired into the algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source +
   evidence link + anchor bullet); index updated (1 source + 1 concept).

## [2026-07-09] ingest | ONCO-CNA-001-Evidence.md → onco-cna-001-evidence (source) + copy-number-alteration-classification (concept)
   Eighth Oncology unit: copy-number alteration classification — a single log2 copy ratio → absolute integer
   CN (n=2·2^log2, CNVkit `_log2_ratio_to_absolute_pure`, diploid ref_copies=2) → discrete CNA state via
   CNVkit `absolute_threshold` hard-threshold caller (default −1.1/−0.25/0.2/0.7 → DeepDeletion/Loss/Neutral/
   Gain/Amplification; first `log2<=thresh` boundary-inclusive→lower bin; above-last→ceil(2·2^log2); NaN→
   neutral CN). Sources CNVkit call.py + docs (germline −0.4/0.3 vs tumor −0.25/0.2, purity≥30% caveat) +
   GISTIC2 Mermel 2011 (±0.1 noise band + +0.848/−0.737 high-amplitude cutoffs) + GISTIC2 -ta/-td docs +
   SV-CNV-001 in-repo overlap check. Judged genuinely DISTINCT from allele-specific ONCO-ASCAT-001 (no allelic
   contrast / purity fit) and from whole-chromosome CHROM-ANEU-001 (per-segment 5-state oncology call vs
   ≥80%-bin chromosome vote) — both share only the n=2·2^log2 conversion; and from SV-CNV-001's round-based
   integer CN (no state classification). New concept created and cross-linked; wired into the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source + evidence link + anchor bullet); index updated
   (1 source + 1 concept). One diploid-ploidy=2 assumption, no source contradictions.
   graph: +2 nodes, +1 typed edge (relates_to → test-unit-registry, on the concept)

## [2026-07-09] ingest | ONCO-CNA-002-Evidence.md → onco-cna-002-evidence (source) + focal-amplification-detection (concept)
   Ninth Oncology unit: focal amplification detection — a two-part predicate `DetectFocalAmplifications`
   keeps segments both amplified (log2 gain > GISTIC2 t_amp 0.1) AND focal (SegLen/ArmLength <
   broad_len_cutoff 0.98 — Mermel 2011's length-based focal/arm-level split; strict < 0.98, exactly 0.98
   → arm-level), then `IdentifyAmplifiedOncogenes` maps each focal amp's arm prefix to a built-in oncogene
   panel (17q→ERBB2, 8q→MYC, 7p→EGFR, 11q→CCND1, 12q→MDM2 AND CDK4, NCBI Gene cytobands). Sources GISTIC2
   Mermel 2011 (Genome Biology, length rule) + GISTIC2 docs (broad_len_cutoff 0.98 / t_amp 0.1) + CNVkit
   (single-copy gain log2(3/2)=0.585 > 0.1 → 0.1 admits all gains) + NCBI Gene oncogene cytobands. Judged
   genuinely DISTINCT from ONCO-CNA-001 (log2→5-state classification): it asks the orthogonal LENGTH
   question and maps to oncogenes, sharing only the GISTIC2 t_amp=0.1 amplitude gate — new concept created
   and cross-linked (relates_to copy-number-alteration-classification, reciprocal body link added there).
   Worked oracles A 17q 0.50/log2 1.0→ERBB2, B 8q 0.99→arm-level, C 7p log2 0.05→not amplified, D 11q 0.98
   boundary→no. Two assumptions (amplitude+length fusion = integration choice; caller supplies arm label +
   length, no cytoband table); deletions out of scope (ONCO-CNA-003); no source contradictions. Wired into

   Homozygous (deep) deletion detection, the deletion mirror of ONCO-CNA-002: filter segments whose

   ONCO-SIG-003 (signature exposure bootstrap confidence intervals), thirty-first Oncology unit and the
   uncertainty layer directly above the ONCO-SIG-002 NNLS refit. Genuinely distinct from the fitting page:
   it adds no decomposition but wraps FitSignatures in a resample→refit→percentile loop producing a
   per-signature CI. Created source onco-sig-003-evidence + new concept
   signature-exposure-bootstrap-confidence-intervals: resample the 96-channel catalog R times (default
   1000, sigminer ≥100), re-run NNLS per replicate, take [2.5%,97.5%] percentiles (Efron 1979) via the
   type-7 sample quantile (Hyndman & Fan 1996, R/NumPy default). Two resampling schemes differing only by
   whether total burden N is fixed — multinomial (sigminer fixed-N, the byte-for-byte default) vs Poisson
   (Senkin 2021 MSA variant, each channel Poisson(observedₖ), N unfixed, Poisson↔multinomial conditional
   equivalence). Discriminating corner case = single non-zero channel: multinomial collapses
   deterministically (width 0) while Poisson(λ>0) fluctuates (var=mean, positive width — the reason the
   Poisson variant was added); plus N=0→[0,0], R=1→lower=upper=mean. Type-7 oracles [0,1,2,3,4]→0.1/2.0/3.9

   ONCO-SIG-004 (mutational process classification), thirty-second Oncology unit and the aetiology-annotation
   layer over the ONCO-SIG-002 NNLS refit. Genuinely distinct from the fitting/bootstrap siblings: adds no
   decomposition but turns per-signature exposures into a set of active mutational processes via
   normalize → cutoff → map → aggregate. Created source onco-sig-004-evidence + new concept
   mutational-process-classification: normalize to relative contributions Wᵢ = exposureᵢ/Σexposure
   (deconstructSigs "weights between 0 and 1"); drop Wᵢ < 0.06 (verbatim signature.cutoff = 0.06 /
   weights[weights < signature.cutoff] <- 0, strict < so exactly 0.06 retained, 1.4% false-negative
   calibration); map each surviving COSMIC label to its proposed aetiology (SBS1/5→Aging, SBS2/13→APOBEC,
   SBS4→Tobacco, SBS7a–d→UV, SBS6/15/20/26→MMR; COSMIC + Alexandrov 2020); sum member contributions per
   process → active-process set + argmax dominant process. Hand-derived oracle SBS2/13/1/4 = 50/30/15/5 →
   APOBEC 0.80 (dominant) / Aging 0.15 / Tobacco 0 (SBS4 0.05 below cutoff). Corner cases: surviving mass < 1
   (rest unknown), multiple simultaneous processes, unmapped/"Unknown"-aetiology label → no process, Σ=0 →
   none. Two source-aligned assumptions (per-process summation, per-signature-cutoff-then-group); no source

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PANGEN-CLUSTER-001-Evidence.md → pan-genome gene clustering
Ingested PANGEN-CLUSTER-001 (Gene Clustering — greedy incremental homolog grouping by sequence
identity), the first pan-genome PANGEN-* unit. New concept [[pan-genome-gene-clustering]] (greedy
incremental CD-HIT-model clustering: long→short, first-match representative assignment, global
identity = identical aligned positions / alignment length; Li & Godzik 2006 + CD-HIT guide + Roary
Page 2015 95% default + EMBOSS needle). New source [[pangen-cluster-001-evidence]]. Wired into the
[[algorithm-validation-evidence]] hub (frontmatter source + source-link list + anchor bullet) and
cross-linked to the comparative-genomics siblings [[genome-comparison-core-dispensable]],
[[ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits]], [[average-nucleotide-identity]]. No source
contradictions; two assumptions (alignment-free identity may underestimate with internal indels;
homolog groups only, no synteny/paralog-split). index updated (1 source + 1 concept).
NOTE: original ingest subagent died mid-run on an API error after writing both pages + the hub

Ingested PANGEN-CORE-001 (pan-genome partition — core/accessory/unique by occupancy + genomic
fluidity + Heaps open/closed; `ConstructPanGenome`). Genuinely distinct from siblings: it is the
N-genome occupancy-based partition (fractional Roary 99% core rule, Kislyuk fluidity, Heaps alpha),
not the clustering step [[pan-genome-gene-clustering]] (PANGEN-CLUSTER-001) nor the pairwise-RBH
[[genome-comparison-core-dispensable]] (COMPGEN-COMPARE-001). Created source [[pangen-core-001-evidence]]
+ concept [[pan-genome-core-accessory-partition]]; cross-linked both siblings; hub

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PANGEN-HEAP-001-Evidence.md
Ingested PANGEN-HEAP-001 (Pan-Genome Growth Model — Heaps'-law fit of the new-gene curve). Genuinely
distinct from the sibling PANGEN-CORE-001: it is the dedicated fitting engine (presence/absence
binarization, micropan first-appearance new-gene curve, bounded power-law least-squares
`y=K·x^(-alpha)`, permutation pooling, open ⟺ alpha<1 rule) that the occupancy partition
[[pan-genome-core-accessory-partition]] only *reports* as one open/closed output — so a dedicated
concept was warranted rather than enriching the partition. Created concept [[pan-genome-heaps-law-fit]]
+ source [[pangen-heap-001-evidence]] (micropan `heaps()` powerlaw.R + Tettelin 2008 power-law openness
+ Tettelin 2005 *S. agalactiae* anchor). Cross-linked the partition sibling (added a fitting-engine

fixed-seed permutation RNG).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PANGEN-MARKER-001-Evidence.md
Fourth PANGEN-* unit (phylogenetic marker selection). Created source summary
[[pangen-marker-001-evidence]] and a NEW concept [[phylogenetic-marker-selection]] (genuinely distinct:
single-copy core marker selection + parsimony-informative-site scoring, not covered by clustering/
partition/Heaps siblings). SelectPhylogeneticMarkers keeps single-copy core clusters (panX "all strains
exactly once" + Roary 99% core + paralog filtering) with PIS≥1, ranked by descending PIS capped at
maxMarkers; CountParsimonyInformativeSites per Zvelebil & Baum 2008 (≥2 states each in ≥2 seqs).

   FileIO PARSE-* family, fourth parsing unit (after BED/EMBL/FASTA). Source page for the FASTQ
   parsing artifact (4-line record @header/seq/+/quality, seq-len==qual-len invariant, Q20/Q30 +

   assumptions Q93-cap-for-p<=0 + ambiguous-window->Phred+33 default; no contradictions). Unlike the
   grammar-only FASTA/EMBL siblings, FASTQ carries a genuine encoding scheme, so created the

   ranges + boundary chars, deterministic per-record offset auto-detection, mis-detection = silent
   corruption) — not yet represented and shared with the Assembly trimming layer. Cross-linked the
   new concept from quality-trimming-running-sum's Phred+33 section (2 inbound links). Linked source

   folded in. Cross-linked as mismatch-tolerant alternative_to [[k-mer-positions]] and fuzzy sibling of

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PHYLO-BOOT-001-Evidence.md → [[phylo-boot-001-evidence]] (source) + [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]] (new concept)
   First phylogenetics (PHYLO-*) unit. Survey confirmed NO general distance-based-phylogenetics
   concept exists yet (no Neighbor-Joining/UPGMA/distance-matrix page), so created a dedicated anchor
   concept for the family: Felsenstein's bootstrap (FBP) — resample alignment columns with replacement
   → same-length pseudo-alignments → tree per replicate (distance matrix → UPGMA/NJ) → clade support =
   fraction of replicate trees containing the identical terminal-leaf-set clade of the reference tree.
   Sources Felsenstein 1985 (Evolution) + Lemoine 2018 (Nature, PMC6030568) + Biopython
   Bio.Phylo.Consensus (get_support terminal-set matching). Oracles: two-group AAAAAAAAAA/GGGGGGGGGG
   UPGMA+JukesCantor seed 42 → support 1.0 (saturated distances), all-identical ACGTACGT → all 1.0.
   Two source-consistent assumptions (rooted-clade vs unrooted bipartition matching Biopython;
   proportion [0,1] vs percentage ×100). Explicitly distinguished from the CCF-constraint oncology
   builder [[tumor-phylogeny-clonal-tree-reconstruction]] (no distance matrix / no resampling) and
   positioned as the confidence layer over the tree [[phylogenetic-marker-selection]] feeds; added a
   reciprocal distinction link on the tumor-phylogeny page. Registered in algorithm-validation-evidence
   hub (frontmatter + source list + own-concept list); index Sources + Concepts updated. No contradictions.
   Follow-up: when NJ/UPGMA/distance-matrix or other PHYLO-* units are ingested, split tree-construction

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PHYLO-COMP-001-Evidence.md → [[phylo-comp-001-evidence]] (source) + [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (new concept)
   Second phylogenetics (PHYLO-*) unit. Judged genuinely distinct from the PHYLO-BOOT-001 bootstrap
   anchor and warranted a dedicated concept: PHYLO-COMP-001 is deterministic tree COMPARISON / query
   over an already-built rooted binary PhyloNode tree, not confidence-by-resampling. Three operations —
   Robinson–Foulds distance (RobinsonFouldsDistance = symmetric difference A+B of canonical split sets;
   raw count, proper metric, even; rooted-clade = Wikipedia dummy-leaf; max RF = 2(n−2) rooted vs
   2(n−3) unrooted, reconciled by dummy-leaf equivalence), MRCA (FindMRCA, O(n) recursive leaf-name
   traversal, not-in-tree→null), patristic distance (PatristicDistance = dist(x,MRCA)+dist(y,MRCA),
   not-in-tree→NaN, zero-branches→0). Sources Wikipedia RF-metric/MRCA/Phylogenetic-tree + Robinson &

   scope decisions (binary-only via PhyloNode Left/Right; rooted-only via UPGMA/NJ); no deviations, no
   contradictions. Cross-linked reciprocally with [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]] (agreement vs
   disagreement of the same split primitive) and distinguished from [[tumor-phylogeny-clonal-tree-reconstruction]].
   Registered in algorithm-validation-evidence hub (frontmatter source list + source_commit bump +

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PHYLO-DIST-001-Evidence.md → phylo-dist-001-evidence (source) + 1 concept
   Third phylogenetics-family (PHYLO-*) Evidence file (after BOOT, COMP). Created the genuinely-distinct
   concept evolutionary-distance-matrix — the pairwise evolutionary-distance substrate the family sits on:
   CalculatePairwiseDistance / CalculateDistanceMatrix over four methods Hamming (raw diff count),
   p-distance (differences/comparableSites, uncorrected), Jukes-Cantor JC69 (-3/4·ln(1−4p/3), equal-base/
   equal-rate model), Kimura-2-parameter K2P (-1/2·ln((1−2S−V)·√(1−2V)), S=transition/V=transversion).
   Matrix invariants symmetric / zero-diagonal / non-negative / n×n, correction ordering JC69≥p & K2P≥p,
   triangle inequality expected-not-guaranteed for corrected distances; pairwise deletion (gaps + ambiguous
   IUPAC N/R/Y skipped, only A,C,G,T compared), case-insensitive; saturation JC69→+∞ at p≥3/4 and K2P→+∞ at
   V≥1/2; all-gap/empty→0 (0/n→0), unequal-length→ArgumentException, null→ArgumentNullException. Oracles
   ACGTACGT/TCGTACGT→Hamming 1/p 0.125/JC69≈0.137, pure-transition GCGT K2P≈0.34657 vs pure-transversion
   CCGT≈0.31713, mixed≈0.30679, gap case→7 comparable sites. Positioned as the UPGMA/NJ substrate that
   bootstrap wraps and re-runs per replicate and that tree-comparison's trees come out of. Sources: Wikipedia
   Models-of-DNA-evolution / Substitution-model / Distance-matrices-in-phylogeny + Jukes & Cantor 1969 +

   evidence hub (frontmatter source list + source_commit bump to 3a53115 + source-summary list + concept
   list); index Sources + Concepts updated. Updated the two prior PHYLO concepts reciprocally: fixed the now-
   stale "no distance-matrix page yet" note in phylogenetic-bootstrap-support and cross-linked evolutionary-
   distance-matrix from both bootstrap and tree-comparison-metrics. Two API-contract assumptions (empty/all-
   gap→0, pairwise deletion for gaps+ambiguity). Contradictions: none — JC69/K2P formulas, symmetric zero-
   diagonal matrix, and saturation limits are the standard textbook definitions. Follow-up: the UPGMA/NJ tree
   *construction* step itself (which consumes this matrix) remains unconcepted and would warrant its own page
   when a PHYLO tree-build unit is ingested.

   Fourth phylogenetics PHYLO-* Evidence file: Newick I/O (ToNewick/ParseNewick), the tree
   serialization layer. Decision: source-only cross-link, NO new concept — Newick is a format
   serializer, not a distinct algorithm; the tree semantics it round-trips already live in the PHYLO
   concept pages. Source page synthesizes the Wikipedia/PHYLIP-Felsenstein/Olsen-1990 grammar,
   label rules, invariants N1–N9, and binary-only/no-quoted-labels/no-comments scope limits. Linked
   from the [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] hub (added to frontmatter sources list + body list) and
   index Sources; cross-linked reciprocally from [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (the PhyloNode trees it
   compares are what Newick serializes) and to [[evolutionary-distance-matrix]] /
   [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]]. No typed concept-to-concept edges (source-only). Contradictions:

   Ingested the Tree Statistics unit (PHYLO-STATS-001): GetLeaves / CalculateTreeLength / GetTreeDepth —
   whole-tree descriptive summaries (leaf count, total branch length = Σ all edges, height in edges).
   Judged genuinely distinct from [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (descriptive summaries vs compare/query
   operations) so created a modest dedicated concept [[tree-statistics]] rather than a source-only
   cross-link. Cross-linked reciprocally with [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (added a paragraph there) and
   to the PHYLO family ([[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]], [[evolutionary-distance-matrix]],
   [[phylo-newick-001-evidence]]). Sources: Wikipedia Tree-(graph-theory)/Tree-(ADT) + Biopython

   Ingested the Tree Construction unit (PHYLO-TREE-001): UPGMA + Neighbor-Joining — the PHYLO family's
   tree-building core that consumes a distance matrix and emits a PhyloNode tree (BuildTree /
   BuildTreeFromMatrix). Created the dedicated concept [[distance-based-tree-construction]] that prior
   PHYLO ingests explicitly flagged as MISSING/WANTED (UPGMA rooted-ultrametric height=d/2 clock;
   NJ minimum-Q additive-topology, negative branches preserved, midpoint-rooted final join). Wired it
   as the family hinge: concept depends_on [[evolutionary-distance-matrix]]; added reciprocal
   depends_on edges + wikilinks on [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]] (wraps it per replicate),

   a_n (Watterson 1975), Tajima's D = (k̂ − S/a_1)/√(e_1·S+e_2·S(S−1)) (Tajima 1989; k̂ = pairwise-
   difference COUNT not per-site π; D<0 sweep/expansion, D>0 balancing/contraction), and Nei-1978
   unbiased gene diversity/heterozygosity (H_obs = n/(n−1)·H_exp ≡ π for haploid). Oracle: Wikipedia
   Tajima's D example n=5/L=20/S=4 → k̂=2.0/π=0.1/θ_W≈0.096/D≈0.273 (TD-C01/TD-C02). Guards n<3→D
   undefined→0, S=0/monomorphic→all 0, Var≤0→D=0. All formulae exact-match; distinct from the
   ancestry anchor (variation amount vs ancestry decomposition). Contradictions: none. Follow-ups: none.

   Foundational population-genetics POP-* primitive — allele/genotype frequencies, minor allele
   frequency (MAF), MAF filtering; the numeric substrate under the POP family (produces the fixed F
   for POP-ANCESTRY-001 and the per-site p_i for POP-DIV-001's heterozygosity term). Biallelic
   allele freq p=f(AA)+½f(AB)/q=f(BB)+½f(AB) via counts total=2·(n_AA+n_AB+n_BB), major=2·n_AA+n_AB,
   minor=2·n_BB+n_AB (INV p+q=1, major+minor=total; four-o'clock oracle 49/42/9→0.70/0.30); VCF/PLINK

   monomorphic→0; 50/50→0.5); MAF filter inclusive [minMAF,maxMAF] band, HapMap/common(>0.05)-vs-
   rare(<0.05) thresholds. Edge cases: zero samples→(0,0), empty vector→MAF 0, negative count→
   ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Scope biallelic counting/normalization only (no HWE, no multiallelic,
   no phasing). All exact-match (Wikipedia Allele/Minor-allele/Genotype frequency + Gillespie 2004 +
   NDSU). Contradictions: none. Follow-ups: none.

## [2026-07-10] ingest | POP-FST-001-Evidence.md → pop-fst-001-evidence (source) + population-differentiation-fst (concept)
   Population-genetics POP-* differentiation unit — Fst (fixation index), F-statistics (Fis/Fit/Fst),
   pairwise Fst. Consumes per-population allele frequencies from POP-FREQ-001. Wright 1965 variance
   Fst = σ_S²/(pBar(1−pBar)); two-pop size-weighted pBar=(n1·p1+n2·p2)/(n1+n2),
   σ_S²=(n1(p1−pBar)²+n2(p2−pBar)²)/(n1+n2); multi-locus ratio-of-sums Σσ_S²/Σhet — computes the
   population PARAMETER from known allele freqs, explicitly NOT the Weir & Cockerham 1984 θ estimator
   (no ANOVA/finite-sample bias correction). F-statistics heterozygosity partition Fis=1−Hi/Hs,
   Fit=1−Hi/Ht, Fst=1−Hs/Ht with exact identity (1−Fit)=(1−Fis)(1−Fst). INV Fst∈[0,1] (0=panmixia,
   1=fixed differences), Fis∈[−1,1] (negative under excess heterozygotes), pairwise matrix symmetric +
   zero diagonal, NOT a metric (fails triangle inequality). Oracles: fixed p1=1/p2=0→1.0 exactly,

## [2026-07-10] ingest | POP-HW-001-Evidence.md → pop-hw-001-evidence (source) + hardy-weinberg-equilibrium-test (concept)
   Population-genetics POP-* unit — Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) chi-square test. Consumes
   genotype counts from POP-FREQ-001 (whose scope explicitly leaves the HWE test to this unit).
   Expected genotype freqs p²/2pq/q² (Hardy 1908 / Weinberg 1908); allele freq p=(2·n_AA+n_Aa)/(2n),
   q=1−p; expected counts E={p²n,2pqn,q²n}; Pearson χ²=Σ(O−E)²/E over 3 genotype classes; df=1
   (#genotypes−#alleles=3−2); p-value via chi-square CDF (lower-incomplete-gamma approx); default
   α=0.05 critical value 3.841. TestHardyWeinberg returns InEquilibrium/ChiSquare/PValue. Oracles:

   goodness-of-fit only; exact test (Wigginton 2005) and multiallelic loci noted out of scope. New

## [2026-07-10] ingest | POP-LD-001.md → pop-ld-001-evidence (source) + linkage-disequilibrium (concept)
   Population-genetics POP-* unit — linkage disequilibrium between two loci (CalculateLD: D, D', r²)
   + haplotype-block detection (FindHaplotypeBlocks). Consumes allele/haplotype frequencies from
   POP-FREQ-001. Sources: Wikipedia Linkage-disequilibrium (D=p_AB−p_A·p_B; Lewontin 1964 D'=|D|/D_max
   sign-branched clamped [0,1]; Hill & Robertson 1968 r²=D²/(p_A·q_A·p_B·q_B); diploid-frequency result
   R_AB=r_AB Wright 1933 ⇒ r² computable WITHOUT phase) + Wikipedia Haplotype-block (Gabriel 2002 /

   Cov²/(Var·Var); D from diploid covariance Cov=2D ⇒ D=Cov/2; FindHaplotypeBlocks = simplified
   adjacent-pair Gabriel (consecutive r²≥threshold, default 0.7, ≥2 variants). Oracles perfect LD→r²≈1,

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/POP-ROH-001-Evidence.md → pop-roh-001-evidence (source) + runs-of-homozygosity-inbreeding (concept)
   POP-ROH-001: runs of homozygosity (FindROH) + genomic inbreeding coefficient F_ROH. Window-free
   consecutive-runs scan (Marras 2015/detectRUNS): grow runs over position-sorted 0/1/2 genotypes,
   terminate on maxOppRun exceeded or gap>maxGap, retain only if minSNP AND minLengthBps pass (PLINK
   --homozyg-snp 100 AND --homozyg-kb 1000). F_ROH = ΣL_roh/L_auto (McQuillan 2008; L_auto≈2,674 Mb;
   oracle 20/100 Mb→0.20, whole-genome→1.0). Two API-encoding assumptions (0/1/2 encoding; missing
   handling out of scope). New concept created — genuinely distinct per-individual segment detection
   vs the other POP siblings (frequencies/diversity/Fst/LD/HWE). Cross-linked all POP concepts +
   ancestry family anchor. Contradictions: none. Follow-ups: none.

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/POP-SELECT-001-Evidence.md — Selection-signature detection (iHS/EHH)
   Ingested the POP-SELECT-001 evidence artifact (integrated Haplotype Score iHS + Extended Haplotype
   Homozygosity EHH scan; CalculateEhh/CalculateIHS/StandardizeIHS/ScanForSelection). Created source
   summary [[pop-select-001-evidence]] and a NEW dedicated concept [[selection-scan-ihs-ehh]] —
   genuinely distinct from the POP siblings: a haplotype-length/decay statistic, not frequencies,
   diversity, Fst, HWE, LD, or ROH. Synthesized the EHH→iHH→iHS→scan pipeline, the trapezoidal iHH
   with the 0.05 cutoff, the Voight vs selscan sign-convention pitfall (ln(iHH_A/iHH_D) vs its
   inverse), worked oracles (rehh F1205400 −1.978569274; constructed panel ln(0.25)=−1.386294361),
   invariants and edge cases. Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources +

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Evidence/PRIMER-TM-001-DIMER-Evidence.md → primer-tm-001-dimer-evidence (source) + primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm (concept)
   First PCR primer-design PRIMER-* / MolTools family unit. New concept
   [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]]: self-/hetero-dimer Tm via Primer3 ntthal thermodynamic
   alignment over the SantaLucia & Hicks 2004 DNA nearest-neighbour model — 10 WC NN stacks +
   initiation + terminal A·T penalty + symmetry, bimolecular Tm with x=1(palindrome)/x=4 factor,
   [Na+] salt correction, full non-contiguous dimer DP (mismatch/loop/bulge/tstack2 overhang)
   reproducing primer3-py 2.3.0 to machine precision; poly-A/invalid → null/NaN. Cross-linked as

   Base PRIMER-TM-001 unit = Primer3 weighted per-primer penalty (objective function) `p_obj_fn` — a
   selection/scoring algorithm, NOT a Tm calc despite the unit ID. Distinct from the sibling dimer-Tm
   [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] (same unit ID), so created a new concept
   [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] and cross-linked both directions (penalty consumes Tm/self-align
   scores as terms). Default objective collapses to |Tm−60|+|len−20|. Updated hub

   Hairpin/secondary-structure extension of PRIMER-TM-001 (intramolecular self-fold MFE +
   unimolecular hairpin Tm). OVERLAP resolved by ENRICHING [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]]
   (same ntthal/thal.c engine, same NnUnifiedParams stem stacks) with a new "Intramolecular
   hairpin self-folding" section (Table 4 loop increments, Eq. 11 no-concentration Tm,
   Jacobson-Stockmayer, exclusions, hairpin oracles) rather than creating a new concept.
   Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources + body evidence-link list)

   Per-oligo NN salt-corrected design Tm (opt-in) for PRIMER-TM-001. Heavy overlap with the

   salt corrections" section (Eq. 3 per-primer Tm; Owczarzy 2004 monovalent-quadratic + Owczarzy
   2008 divalent-Mg²⁺/dNTP 1/Tm corrections, Biopython salt_correction methods 5–7; DNA_IMM/DNA_DE

   oracles). Enriched concept [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] rather than creating a new one —

   no 5'-G reporter-quench, more-C-than-G + antisense strand fallback, ≥4-G run, GC 30-80%,
   length 18-22, probe Tm ≥ primer Tm + 10) so created new PROBE-family anchor concept
   [[taqman-probe-design-rules]]; it reuses the PRIMER-TM-001-validated salt-adjusted Tm engine

   (1:2:1 weights, evidence-based constraints, Probability=Score, strict {A,G,S}, PROSITE-pattern scope,
   FindDomains naming), not open assumptions. Contradictions: none — the encyclopedic + PROSITE/Pfam +

- 2026-07-10 — ingest docs/Evidence/PROTMOTIF-FIND-001-Evidence.md (Protein Motif Search, Pattern-based). Genuinely distinct from the fixed-dictionary [[common-protein-motifs]]: this is the GENERAL engine `ProteinMotifFinder.FindMotifByPattern` that takes an arbitrary caller-supplied PROSITE pattern, of which FindCommonMotifs is one application. New concept [[protein-motif-pattern-search]] covering three primitives — `ConvertPrositeToRegex` (PROSITE→regex element map), `FindMotifByPattern` (overlapping-match discovery via zero-width lookahead `(?=(pattern))` per ScanProsite; 0-based Start/End; case-insensitive; empty/null→empty; invalid regex handled gracefully), and information-content scoring `CalculateMotifScore` IC=Σlog₂(20/allowed_count) + `CalculateEValue` E=(N−L+1)·2^(−IC) (Schneider & Stephens 1990; the earlier BLAST/Altschul citation was explicitly REMOVED because the E-value is a direct combinatorial probability, not Karlin–Altschul EVD). Pins the PROSITE-pattern catalog and records two FIXED implementation bugs — PS00007 loosened `.{2,3}`→exact `[RK].{2}[DE].{3}Y`, and PS00018 EF-hand (`x`→`{W}` at pos 2 + restored dropped trailing `[LIVMFYW]`); five non-PROSITE linear motifs (NLS1/NES1/SIM1/WW1/SH3_1) re-derived from primary literature. Concise source page [[protmotif-find-001-evidence]]. Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources + body evidence-link list + source_commit→HEAD) and wiki/index.md (source entry + concept entry). Corrected a forward-reference in [[common-protein-motifs]]: its "general engine" pointer said "PROTMOTIF-PATTERN unit" but the general engine is actually this unit, PROTMOTIF-FIND-001 (`FindMotifByPattern`) — repointed to [[protein-motif-pattern-search]]. Deviations/assumptions: all eliminated per the Evidence change history (patterns corrected, non-PROSITE patterns literature-verified, heuristic scoring replaced by IC scoring, overlapping-match lookahead implemented); only the 0-based-vs-ScanProsite-1-based coordinate convention stands (no correctness effect). Contradictions: none — PROSITE/ScanProsite + Schneider & Stephens + the five primary refs agree; flagged the stale sibling-page forward-reference as noted above. Follow-ups: PROTMOTIF-PATTERN-001 (if a distinct unit exists) and remaining ProteinMotif units (transmembrane-helix etc.) not yet ingested.

SAME ALGORITHM as DISORDER-LC-001 — SEG (Wootton & Federhen 1993), identical defaults W=12/K1=2.2/K2=2.5, identical Shannon-entropy bits/residue complexity `−Σpᵢlog₂pᵢ` (max log₂20≈4.322), identical two-stage trigger(≤K1)/extend(≤K2) scan. NOT a different low-complexity method: this is the ProteinMotif-family registration of the SEG unit, a second Evidence file tracing the same method. Therefore NO new concept — enriched/cross-linked the existing anchor [[protein-low-complexity-seg]] (added PROTMOTIF-LC-001-Evidence to its frontmatter sources, added a body paragraph documenting the second unit, added a relates_to test-unit-registry graph edge sourced from protmotif-lc-001-evidence, bumped source_commit→HEAD).

Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources + body evidence-link list + source_commit→HEAD) and wiki/index.md (Sources-section entry only). Contradictions: none — the artifact fully agrees with the DISORDER-LC-001 evidence; the only new primary vs DISORDER-LC-001 is Pei & Grishin 2005.

SECOND Evidence over the SAME PROSITE→regex engine as PROTMOTIF-FIND-001 — NO new concept; enriched [[protein-motif-pattern-search]] (added the end-to-end `FindMotifByProsite` primitive row; added `A(n)`→`A{n}` and trailing-`.` terminator to the conversion table; added a "PA-line grammar corner cases" subsection — ranges only on `x` (`A(2,4)` invalid, `A(3)` valid), trailing period terminates, **reject the `*` Kleene star with FormatException** since `<{C}*>` is a ScanProsite query extension not PA-line grammar; added the second source + source_commit→HEAD; noted the PROTMOTIF-PATTERN-001 revalidation in the anchor sentence and References).

Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources + body evidence-link list + source_commit→HEAD) and wiki/index.md (Sources-section entry + a revalidation clause on the [[protein-motif-pattern-search]] concept entry). Two ASSUMPTIONs in the artifact (lookahead overlap enumeration is a repo contract not PROSITE-mandated; combinatorial E=(N−L+1)·2^(−IC) is a model quantity, not the ScanProsite Swiss-Prot-frequency E-value). Contradictions: none — fully consistent with PROTMOTIF-FIND-001 (same engine, IC per Schneider & Stephens 1990, pattern-is-regex per De Castro 2006). Follow-ups: FindDomains is jointly owned by [[protein-domain-and-signal-peptide-prediction]] (PROTMOTIF-DOMAIN-001) — added a medium-confidence relates_to edge rather than duplicating that unit's coverage.

Wrote concise source page [[protmotif-prosite-001-evidence]] recording the PROSITE User Manual PA-line spec + ScanProsite docs (extended syntax `-` omittable when unambiguous `MASKE`=`M-A-S-K-E`; greedy/overlap/include match modes), PS00001/00028 entries, Hulo 2007 + De Castro 2006, and the conversion/matching oracle tables.

AT skew is genuinely unrepresented → created ONE reusable FAMILY concept [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] covering BOTH AT skew and its GC-skew sibling (rather than a page per member), so a future GC-skew ingest enriches it.

One documented ASSUMPTION: the lowercase + non-ACGT handling for the AT-skew member is inferred by analogy from the shipped `GC_skew` (Biopython ships no AT-skew line) — the formula itself is fully sourced, only the symbol-handling convention is by analogy, and it matches the repository (`ToUpperInvariant`, counts only A/T).

This unit is the **normalized, frame-aware frequency** view — a genuinely distinct METHOD but the SAME family, so per the economy directive NO new concept was created; enriched the closest concept [[codon-usage-comparison]] instead. Distinct from the raw-count sibling `CodonOptimizer.CalculateCodonUsage` (CODON-USAGE-001) on four points: returns count/total fractions (`IReadOnlyDictionary<string,double>`) not `int` counts; adds a **reading-frame offset** (0/1/2) so the same sequence yields a different multiset (the distinctive new semantic); **excludes non-ACGT/ambiguous triplets** from count and total (Kazusa CUTG "ambiguous codons excluded"); keeps **DNA-native** keys (no T→U rewrite).

Follow-ups: the standalone linguistic-complexity unit SEQ-COMPLEX-001 (`docs/algorithms/Sequence_Composition/Linguistic_Complexity.md`) is still not separately ingested — when it is, it enriches [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] (the per-sequence LC scalar this windows) rather than creating a new page; Shannon character-entropy remains the last un-ingested named complexity member.

CONTEXT check: searched wiki/concepts for composition/gc-content/base-count/nucleotide/sequence-statistics and read the sibling [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] (SEQ-ATSKEW-001). The **skew** family (GC/AT skew asymmetry) is already a concept, but NO concept covered the foundational **base/residue composition** layer — the per-symbol counts, the A/T/G/C/U/N/Other partition, GC content, or amino-acid composition. GENUINELY DISTINCT (magnitude/fraction view vs the skew asymmetry view; different outputs) → NEW concept [[base-composition]], cross-linked as the sibling of [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] (which derives from the same counts) and the base layer under [[cpg-island-detection]] (dinucleotide O/E), [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] (window Shannon of base composition), and the GC constraints in [[taqman-probe-design-rules]]/[[codon-optimization]]. Fully sourced: Biopython `Bio.SeqUtils.gc_fraction` (`gc=sum(count(x) for x in "CGScgs")`, `gc/length` ∈ [0,1], **empty ⇒ 0**, case-insensitive) + Wikipedia "GC skew" (GC/AT skew formulas, cumulative-skew origin/terminus — skew detail delegated to the sibling concept) + IUPAC codes (canonical A/C/G/T/U + degenerate/N; the 20 standard amino-acid letters). Hand-derived oracles `ATGC`→GC 0.5/skew 0, `GGGC`→GC 1.0/GC-skew 0.5/AT-skew 0 (a+t=0), `AAUUGGCC`→A/T/G/C/U 2/0/2/2/2, GC 0.5/AT-skew 1.0, `MKVLWA`→6 residues each 1. Corner cases: empty/null ⇒ all-zero composition; no G or C ⇒ zero-denominator skew 0.0; mixed case ⇒ case-insensitive; non-canonical letters (N, degenerate, X) tracked separately via `CountN`/`CountOther`, never folded into A/T/G/C/U. One ASSUMPTION (source-flagged): degenerate IUPAC codes excluded from GC/AT totals — Biopython's `gc_fraction` counts S toward GC and W toward the denominator, whereas the repo counts only A/T/G/C/U; the two agree **exactly** over the {A,T,G,C,U} alphabet (this unit's scope), differing only on degenerate symbols. NOTE: the Change History records SEQ-COMPOSITION-001 is a **duplicate/consolidated Registry entry** for the two composition methods already delivered under SEQ-STATS-001 (TestSpec §7) — a documentation/registry artifact over an existing implementation, not a new algorithm. Wrote source page [[seq-composition-001-evidence]] + concept [[base-composition]]; updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources +SEQ-COMPOSITION-001 + body evidence-link list; source_commit left at its prior value) and wiki/index.md (Sources + Concepts entries); added a reciprocal sibling bullet to [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] (navigation-only, frontmatter untouched — not derived from this source). Graph: one typed edge on the new concept, `relates_to concept:test-unit-registry` (the standard per-unit registration edge); no source-backed concept-to-concept edge (the source defines composition; it does not assert a typed relation to skew/CpG/complexity — those are wiki-navigational siblings). Contradictions: none — Biopython, Wikipedia, and IUPAC agree on formulas and alphabet; the degenerate-code handling is a documented scope simplification, not a conflict. Follow-ups: **SEQ-STATS-001 is not yet ingested** — when it is, it is the original home of these two composition methods and should enrich [[base-composition]] rather than create a new page; the GC-skew member (`gc-skew`) flagged on [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] is also still un-ingested.

CONTEXT check per brief: searched wiki/concepts + index for structural/variant/breakpoint/split-read/discordant/CNV/SV — found NO germline-SV concept; the closest existing pages are the ONCOLOGY read-evidence [[gene-fusion-detection-read-evidence]] (STAR-Fusion/Arriba transcript fusion calling) and [[chromothripsis-inference]] (ONCO-SV-001 copy-number pattern), plus the gene-order [[genome-rearrangement-breakpoint-distance]] — all distinct topics. DECISION: **NEW concept warranted** — this is a genuinely distinct germline structural-variant method (breakpoint localization from CIGAR soft-clip junctions + positional clustering) and the **first of the germline SV family** (StructuralVariantAnalyzer). Created [[breakpoint-detection-split-reads]] as the family anchor. The soft-clip signature: CIGAR **`S` consumes the read (SEQ) but not the reference** and sits only at a read end → leading `S` = **left / L-breakpoint**, trailing `S` = **right / R-breakpoint**, no-`S` read = no signal; the breakpoint is the **marginal point between clipped and matched sequence** (single-base resolution). Clustering rule: per-read junctions grouped under **positional tolerance** (ClipCrop "clustered within 5-base differences", 5 b), **minimum support** (SoftSearch ≥ x soft-clipped reads at a position, default 5 configurable to 2; support = # clipped reads in cluster) and **same clip-side + same chromosome**, with a **min clip length** filter (≤ 5 clipped bases dropped) and `RefineBreakpoint`. Repository `SplitRead` record stores the junction directly (`PrimaryPosition` = anchored SAM POS / `SupplementaryPosition` = junction coordinate / `ClipLength`). Oracles: 3 reads @ 5000 ± ≤ 5 b same chr support ≥ 2 → one breakpoint ~5000; 1 isolated read → none; 5000 vs 5100 (gap > tolerance) → two below-support groups → none.

DECISION: read-depth CNV segmentation is a genuinely distinct method (aggregate depth signal, not split-read junctions) → NEW concept [[read-depth-cnv-segmentation]] as the read-depth member of the germline SV family, cross-linked to the split-read anchor. Pipeline: read depth ∝ CN (Yoon 2009) → windowed counting (non-overlapping fixed windows, one read per start, per-window mean RD) → optional GC correction r_i'=r_i·m/m_GC → log2 ratio log2(observed/reference depth), reference = overall median of window means (default self-reference) → integer CN = round(2·2^log2) (CNVkit "round", diploid ploidy 2) → del/dup call + segment merge (DetectCNV/SegmentCopyNumber).

DECISION: discordant-read-pair (PEM) detection is a GENUINELY DISTINCT read-evidence signature from split reads (span + orientation geometry of a mate pair, not within-read clip junctions) → NEW dedicated concept [[discordant-pair-sv-detection]] as the third germline-SV read-evidence channel; cross-linked the split-read anchor (added the discordant-pair sibling to its relation paragraph). Method: concordant = FR proper pair (SAM FLAG 0x02, upstream + / downstream −; RF is everted/discordant, NOT proper); span-discordant iff insertSize < μ−c·σ OR > μ+c·σ (BreakDancer -c, default 3 s.d. of the empirical insert-size distribution); classify — span > μ+c·σ FR → Deletion, span < μ−c·σ → Insertion, FF/RR → Inversion, everted RF → tandem Duplication, mates on different chromosomes → Translocation; signature-then-cluster with min support ≥ -r read pairs (default 2). Datasets (mean=400/sd=50/c=3 ⇒ bounds [250,550]): FR span 5000 → Deletion, FR span 100 → Insertion, FF → Inversion, RF → Duplication, chr1≠chr2 → Translocation, FR span 400 → not discordant. One flagged ASSUMPTION — inter-chromosomal (CTX/translocation) precedence evaluated BEFORE orientation, since inversion (INV) is defined only for intra-chromosomal flipped pairs.

Oracles: TPM A(X=10,l=2000)/B(20,4000)/C(30,1000) → (125000,125000,750000)/Σ=10⁶; FPKM X=1000,l=2000,N=10⁶ → 500; quantile C1=(5,2,3,4)/C2=(4,1,4,2)/C3=(3,4,6,8), rank means 2.0/3.0/4.666…/5.666…, C2's two tied `4`s (rows A,C) → 5.166… (final 5.17). Corner cases: all-zero counts → Σ(X/l)=0 → TPM 0/0 undefined → emit 0 for all genes; non-positive length/N → FPKM 0, excluded from RPK; empty → empty (all three). Two source-backed ASSUMPTIONs (all-zero TPM → 0 degenerate convention; effective length = annotated length, `l̃_i=l_i` standard substitution). Scope: classic count-normalization layer, NOT an effective-length fragment model (kallisto/salmon) or TMM/median-of-ratios size factors (edgeR/DESeq2); TPM/RPKM are within-sample relative measures misused across samples/protocols (Zhao 2020); research-grade, not for clinical use. Wrote source [[trans-expr-001-evidence]] + concept [[expression-quantification]]. Cross-linked: reciprocal prose links with the anchor [[differential-expression]] (DE consumes normalized expression upstream; updated the anchor's closing line + downstream paragraph and its "future siblings" note) plus one typed `relates_to` edge to it; also `relates_to` [[test-unit-registry]]. Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources +TRANS-EXPR-001 + source_commit→HEAD deb32560; body evidence-link enumeration) and wiki/index.md (Sources + Concepts entries). Contradictions: none — Wagner 2012, Zhao/Ye/Stanton 2020, Pimentel 2014 and Bolstad 2003 are mutually consistent. Follow-ups: remaining TranscriptomeAnalyzer siblings (PCA/k-means clustering/co-expression, alternative/differential splicing PSI/deltaPSI, RNA-seq library QC) not yet ingested.

- 2026-07-10 — ingest docs/Evidence/TRANS-PROT-001-Evidence.md (Whole-sequence protein translation — the `Translator` class: framed / six-frame translation + genetic-code-parameterized ORF finding, area Translation). CONTEXT check per brief: read [[genetic-code-translation]] (TRANS-CODON-001, the codon→AA table), [[open-reading-frame-detection]] (GENOMIC-ORF-001, ATG-only standard-code six-frame scanner), and searched wiki/concepts + index for translation/translator/six-frame/protein/reading-frame — the prior TRANS-CODON ingest had explicitly flagged "whole-sequence framed translation (`Translator`, six-frame)" as an adjacent not-yet-ingested unit that would ENRICH the codon-table concept. DECISION: **enrich, no new concept** — `Translator` is the sequence-level layer directly ABOVE the codon table it composes (via a `GeneticCode` parameter), so it belongs on [[genetic-code-translation]] rather than a standalone page; economical + strongly preferred by brief. Content added: framed translation (`frame` 0/1/2, else throws), six-frame dict keyed −3…+3 excluding 0 (3 fwd + 3 rev-comp, each 5'→3'), optional `toFirstStop`, DNA↔RNA T→U + case-insensitive + trailing partial codon untranslated, and `Translator.FindOrfs` (genetic-code-parameterized, min-length + both-strand) — deliberately NOT contract-equivalent to `GenomicAnalyzer.FindOpenReadingFrames` ([[open-reading-frame-detection]], ATG-only/standard-code) nor annotation-layer `GenomeAnnotator.FindOrfs`. Oracle: human insulin B chain (UniProt P01308 pos 25–54) 90-nt DNA → `FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKT` (30 aa); all 4 tables (1/2/3/11) verified codon-by-codon vs NCBI (2024-09-23). Sources: Wikipedia Translation-biology / Reading-frame / Open-reading-frame + NCBI Genetic Codes + UniProt P01308. **No contradictions** (Deviations: None). Wrote source [[trans-prot-001-evidence]]; enriched concept [[genetic-code-translation]] (frontmatter sources +TRANS-PROT-001 + source_commit bumped to HEAD; new "Whole-sequence framed translation" section; intro + Scope + Reference-sources updated; +1 typed graph edge relates_to test-unit-registry for the new unit). Updated hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] (frontmatter sources +TRANS-PROT-001; body source-link enumeration) and wiki/index.md (Sources entry + genetic-code-translation concept line). Follow-ups: the MCP `TranslateDna`/`TranslateRna` surface remains an adjacent not-yet-ingested wrapper unit.

   Same whole-sequence `Translator` six-frame surface as TRANS-PROT-001 — per the brief, ENRICHED
   [[genetic-code-translation]] rather than creating a redundant concept. Created source page
   trans-sixframe-001-evidence: reference-implementation angle (Biopython six_frame_translations =
   governing algorithm; EMBOSS transeq frame values 1/2/3/F/-1/-2/-3/R/6; EMBOSS getorf -find 1
   START→STOP; NCBI transl_table=1; Wikipedia Reading-frame). Distinctive new detail folded into the
   concept: the **reverse-frame numbering convention** — repo uses Biopython **independent-offset**
   (frame -k = reverse-complement translated 5'→3' at offset k-1, no correspondence to +1), the
   documented "alternative" to EMBOSS's phase-locked default; `ACTGG` frame -1 = `P` here vs `S` under
   EMBOSS = labelling convention, NOT a bug (flagged as such, no contradiction). Also clarified
   `Translator.FindOrfs` = START→STOP, start-residue included/stop excluded, minLength in **amino acids**
   (getorf -minsize is nucleotides). Oracles: 39-nt six-frame table; GGGATGAAACCCTAAGGG → MKP (start 3,

   TRANS-SPLICE-001 — RNA-seq alternative / differential splicing: event classification + Percent-
   Spliced-In (PSI, Ψ). Per brief, read the Transcriptome-family concepts ([[differential-expression]],
   [[expression-quantification]]) first and CONFIRMED this is RNA-seq read-quantification of splicing
   (PSI from inclusion/exclusion reads), NOT the genomic splice-site motif predictors
   [[splice-donor-site-prediction]] / [[splice-acceptor-site-prediction]] /
   [[gene-structure-prediction-intron-exon]]. DECISION: NEW concept [[alternative-splicing-psi]] —
   genuinely distinct from both the DE anchor (gene-level mean test) and the genomic splice family
   (sequence-motif scoring); anchored on the transcriptome family via [[differential-expression]], with
   a disambiguation cross-link (body + index) to the genomic splice family. `TranscriptomeAnalyzer.

   readout; five canonical AS classes (SE/RI/A5SS/A3SS/MXE, Wang 2008 = rMATS codes), event needs ≥2
   isoforms. Oracles: (80,20)→0.80; (80,20,200,100)→0.6666…. Corner cases: 0/0→NaN, S=0→1, I=0→0,

   GOVERNANCE. New source page for the live per-unit validation status tracker — the ground-truth
   "where things stand" board (distinct from the test-unit-registry ID-scheme/spec and from the
   superseded findings-register snapshot). Captured the two-context protocol (fresh session/unit,
   implementer != validator, external primary sources, mutation checks), Stage A/B + State legend,

   First per-unit VALIDATION REPORT ingested (all prior sources were Evidence/governance docs). New source

   faithful to Wikipedia — border d·j/d·i, max-of-three recurrence, GCATGCG/GATTACA optimum 0, GapExtend-as-d),
   Stage B PASS (GlobalAlignCore+Traceback + cancellation overload, 13/13 cross-verification table, integer DP
   no overflow), State CLEAN, no defects; one documented non-defect (empty-DnaSequence overload returns
   score-0 empty alignment vs string overload's AlignmentResult.Empty). Kept it as a source summary distinct
   from the pre-impl [[align-global-001-evidence]]. ENRICHED concept [[global-alignment-needleman-wunsch]]

   — genuinely unrepresented (siblings global-alignment-needleman-wunsch and semi-global-alignment-fitting
   each had a concept; local existed only in their comparison tables; slug reserved in backlog). Tied the
   report to [[validation-ledger]]/[[validation-protocol]] (did NOT force the algorithm-validation-evidence

   One minor note (not a contradiction): the concept's numbered list of "three implementations" omits
   MultipleAlignProgressive (lists star/iterative/consistency), while the report treats progressive as a

   value) and three docs (algorithm doc 2.2 / Evidence / TestSpec). Discriminating cross-check: both-zero case
   scores ln4 = 1.3862943611198906, not the diluted value. Kept distinct from the pre-impl
   [[annot-coding-001-evidence]] artifact. ENRICHED existing concept [[coding-potential-hexamer-score]] (added
   report to sources + commit bump + one-line both-zero-defect cross-link on the exact branch). Did NOT create a
   new concept (coding-potential/CPAT/hexamer already represented) and did NOT force the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub; tied the report to [[validation-ledger]]/[[validation-protocol]]. Updated
   wiki/index.md (Sources). No backlog move (validation reports are coverage-excluded, not a backlog slug). No
   contradictions flagged (the report itself corrects a prior doc/test transcription error, now consistent).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Validation/reports/ANNOT-CODONUSAGE-001.md → annot-codonusage-001-report (source) + 1 concept
   New source page annot-codonusage-001-report (Stage A/B two-stage validation write-up for RSCU,
   GenomeAnnotator.GetCodonUsage at GenomeAnnotator.cs:922-992: Stage A PASS, Stage B PASS-WITH-NOTES, State
   CLEAN, full suite 6568/0). NO code defect — the formula n_i·x/Σx was confirmed VERBATIM against LIRMM/Rivals
   and cubar est_rscu, families/stops against NCBI table 1; the PASS-WITH-NOTES qualifier is solely three
   test-only coverage gaps closed in-session with zero code change (Trp single-codon=1.0, the 61-sense-codon
   set/stop exclusion, the empty-enumerable Array.Empty branch). Kept distinct from the pre-impl

   (added report to sources + commit bump 9ce49ba->987ea6c + one-line CLEAN-verdict cross-link). Did NOT create a
   new concept (RSCU already fully represented) and did NOT force the algorithm-validation-evidence hub; tied the

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Validation/reports/ANNOT-GENE-001.md → annot-gene-001-report (source) + prokaryotic-gene-prediction-rbs (concept)
   New source page annot-gene-001-report (Stage A/B two-stage validation write-up for ORF-based prokaryotic
   gene prediction + Shine-Dalgarno RBS detection — GenomeAnnotator.PredictGenes / FindRibosomeBindingSites /
   FindRibosomeBindingSitesBothStrands / ScanStrandForShineDalgarno: Stage A PASS, Stage B PASS, State CLEAN,
   filtered suite GenomeAnnotator_Gene_Tests 39/0). NO code defect — an INDEPENDENT re-validation that
   re-fetched every consensus/spacing value (SD AGGAGG, anti-SD YACCUCCUUA, ~8 nt location, 5 nt optimal
   aligned spacing / Chen 1994) and HAND-re-derived every reverse-strand coordinate in Python without lifting
   repo expected values; the reverse-strand SD mapping forwardPos = len − hit.position − motifLen (scan the
   reverse complement, since the SD is an mRNA feature) was mutation-falsified (forwardPosition = hit.position
   → R1/R3/R4 fail), zero code change. UNLIKE the two prior report ingests, gene prediction + strand/spacing-
   aware SD RBS detection was genuinely UNREPRESENTED (open-reading-frame-detection is the Analysis-layer ORF
   sibling and explicitly excludes the annotation layer; regulatory-element-detection only lists a bare AGGAGG
   catalog string) — so CREATED a new concept [[prokaryotic-gene-prediction-rbs]] and added surgical back-links
   from [[open-reading-frame-detection]] (scope section) and [[regulatory-element-detection]] (SD row). Kept
   distinct from any annot-gene-001-evidence artifact; did NOT force the algorithm-validation-evidence hub;
   tied the report to [[validation-ledger]]/[[validation-protocol]]. Updated wiki/index.md (+1 source, +1
   concept). No backlog move — the Annotation/Gene_Prediction.md slug is resolved only when a concept lists that
   algorithm doc in sources:; this concept's source is the coverage-excluded validation report (per instruction
   #7), same as the ANNOT-CODING/CODONUSAGE report precedent. No contradictions flagged.

   a FRESH re-validation of the campaign export-fidelity fix (real source/score columns + per-transcript
   cumulative CDS phase on both strands), with SO GFF3 Spec v1.26 retrieved live and phases hand-recomputed
   against the canonical EDEN gene: plus-strand cds00003 = 0,1,1; cds00001 = 0,0,0,0; minus-strand (input

   (the FileIO GffParser, different code path + record type: GeneAnnotation 0-based half-open export vs
   GenomicFeature file-1-based parse). Did NOT create a new concept — the GFF3 9-column format is already
   anchored on [[bed-format-parsing]]; surgically updated that concept instead (added the report to sources: +
   a cross-link paragraph noting the second, annotation-layer GFF3 path and the CDS-phase formula). Did NOT
   force the algorithm-validation-evidence hub; tied the report to [[validation-ledger]] / [[validation-protocol]]

   No backlog move — the Annotation/GFF3_IO.md (gff3-io) slug resolves only when a concept lists that ALGORITHM

   `position` is a 0-based string index, not the biological TSS-relative negative coordinate.
   CREATED a new concept [[promoter-detection]] — genuinely unrepresented: this scored −10/−35
   detector is a DIFFERENT code path from the exact-hexamer catalog scan
   [[regulatory-element-detection]] (MOTIF-REGULATORY-001, GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif), which
   the existing concept itself flagged as "un-ingested". Sourced the concept from both the
   report and docs/algorithms/Annotation/Promoter_Detection.md; surgically cross-linked
   regulatory-element-detection (replaced the "un-ingested" note with the sibling link). Did
   NOT force the algorithm-validation-evidence hub; tied the report to [[validation-ledger]] /

   from pending Annotation (4→3) to covered-via-concept (75→76 covered, 170→169 pending), since
   the new concept lists that algorithm doc in sources:. Updated wiki/index.md (+1 source, +1

   cutadapt quality_trim_index = 0/900k mismatches. Tied to validation-ledger + validation-and-testing.
   Surgically corrected the concept quality-trimming-running-sum: its "5'-pass-on-surviving-window"

   vs out-paralogs; A3 the 50% coverage gate is largely subsumed by the identity gate, a 200k-pair brute
   force found no separating input — a consequence of A1). FindOrthologs delegates to FindReciprocalBestHits
   (single source of truth, locked by S5); the historical non-reciprocity defect is already fixed (M2:

   1997 + Remm 2001 confirmed; Python 5-mer Jaccard recomputation reproduced every asserted identity (1.0 /

   Stage-A notes: N1 = one bounded assumption (exact dip flank/run-length parameters live in Oldfield 2005's
   paywalled Methods -> documented qualitative criterion; load-bearing constants all source-traceable, not a
   correctness error); N2 = spec-prose M1 coordinate nit "20-34" -> 29-50/len22/score0.275934 corrected
   (doc-only, no code/test change); N3 = iota-subtype naming confirmed correct vs Mohan 2006 verbatim
   (Wikipedia less precise). ENRICHED the existing concept morf-prediction-dip-in-disorder (already the MoRF
   anchor) rather than a new concept — MoRF prediction is genuinely distinct but already represented: added
   report to sources, bumped source_commit to dc13c70f + updated 2026-07-10, updated intro to cite the report
   + validation-ledger. New source-summary page disorder-morf-001-report. Updated wiki/index.md (+1 source
   line). Tied to validation-ledger / validation-and-testing / test-unit-registry; did NOT force the
   algorithm-validation-evidence hub. Kept distinct from the evidence artifact disorder-morf-001-evidence.
   No contradictions. Backlog: the ProteinPred MoRF_Prediction algorithm-doc slug (morf-prediction) is a
   separate algorithm-doc reconciliation item, not this validation report (excluded from coverage) — no
   pending slug to move.

   Two-stage validation report for test unit DISORDER-PRED-001 — the CORE per-residue intrinsic-disorder
   predictor DisorderPredictor.PredictDisorder (the shared PredictDisorder anchor the whole protein-disorder
   family reads from). Stage A PASS / Stage B PASS / End state CLEAN, full DisorderPredictor test family
   113/113 green (focused DisorderPredictor_DisorderPrediction_Tests 22/22), NO code changed this session, no

## [2026-07-10] ingest | docs/Validation/reports/DISORDER-PROPENSITY-001.md → disorder-propensity-001-report (source)
   Two-stage validation report for test unit DISORDER-PROPENSITY-001 — the O(1) per-residue propensity
   primitives beneath the sliding-window predictor: the raw TOP-IDP Table-2 lookup GetDisorderPropensity +
   Dunker order/disorder/ambiguous classification (IsDisorderPromoting / DisorderPromotingAminoAcids /
   OrderPromotingAminoAcids / AmbiguousAminoAcids), DisorderPredictor.cs:680-712 over the DisorderPropensity
   dict :85-107 and the three sets :111-121. Stage A PASS / Stage B PASS / End state CLEAN, full UNFILTERED
   suite 6609 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped (14-test canonical fixture green), NO code/test/spec change this
   session, no divergences. Scope note: the session prompt's sliding-window smoothing / mean-disorder profile
   is NOT this unit — it lives in PredictDisorder under DISORDER-PRED-001; per Registry
   (ALGORITHMS_CHECKLIST_V2.md 3658-3676) + Method Index (5070-5073) this unit is scoped to the O(1) lookup +
   classification, validated as registered. GetDisorderPropensity returns the RAW un-normalized value
   (W-0.884...P+0.987), NOT the [0,1] normalized Si PredictDisorder uses. All 20 Table-2 values match exactly
   vs Campen 2008 PMC2676888 (WebFetch, Table 2 verbatim), min W=-0.884 / max P=0.987 confirmed; Dunker 8/8/4
   sets disorder {A,R,G,Q,S,P,E,K} / order {W,C,F,I,Y,V,L,N} / ambiguous {H,M,T,D} match, union 20 pairwise

   numbers); PubMed 18991772 / USF DigitalCommons / Bentham confirm the rank string. Pitfall confirmed +
   correctly handled: rendered rank string places ...Q,K,S,E,P but Table-2 values give S=0.341<K=0.586 (by
   value ...Q,S,K,E,P) — presentation artifact, numeric values authoritative, both locked. Edge semantics:
   scale defined for 20 standard residues only, unknown->0.0 (GetValueOrDefault contract, not source value),
   case-fold via ToUpperInvariant — both impl contracts, honestly registered. HARD test-quality gate PASS:
   fixture hardcodes sourced literals (not code echoes) M1/M2 exact values + M6/M7/M8 exact set equivalence +
   counts; M3 disorder->true / M4 order->false / M5 ambiguous->false exercise both predicate branches; exact
   Is.EqualTo(...).Within(1e-10) + Is.EquivalentTo+Count, no Greater/AtLeast/Contains where exact known, no
   widened tolerance, no skipped tests; all 5 members + both branches + edge/contract cases (unknown X/Z/B/*
   ->0.0, lowercase, sorted property order) covered; honest green on full unfiltered suite. IsDisorderPromoting
   <=> membership in DisorderPromotingAminoAcids (M10) consistent. Findings: NONE at both stages. SURGICALLY
   updated the existing concept intrinsic-disorder-prediction-top-idp (already the shared PredictDisorder
   anchor + already hosts the DISORDER-PROPENSITY-001 primitives section) rather than a new concept — the
   primitives are already fully represented: added the report to sources, bumped source_commit to 540cb0df,
   added a one-line CLEAN verdict cross-link to disorder-propensity-001-report + validation-ledger in the
   primitives section. New source-summary page disorder-propensity-001-report. Updated wiki/index.md (+1 source

## 2026-07-10 — ingest docs/Validation/reports/DISORDER-REGION-001.md
   Ingested the per-unit VALIDATION REPORT for DISORDER-REGION-001 (disordered-region detection — the
   segment-calling layer collapsing the per-residue PredictDisorder TOP-IDP profile into contiguous IDR
   regions, plus opt-in MobiDB-lite v3 flavour typing). Re-validated 2026-06-25, supersedes 2026-06-24 pass
   (reset to pending after F4 ClassifyRegionFlavorMobiDbLite added). Verdict Stage A PASS-WITH-NOTES / Stage B
   PASS / End state CLEAN. Region-calling logic (IdentifyDisorderedRegions DisorderPredictor.cs:358, single-pass
   with explicit trailing-run branch -> no off-by-one; ClassifyDisorderedRegion :428 / CalculateConfidence
   :470) validated correct + sourced: consecutive-grouping score>=0.542, configurable minRegionLength default 5,

   S30 0.655/0.246 — all matching test assertions. Stage-B fidelity DEFECT found and FULLY FIXED this session:
   ClassifyRegionFlavorMobiDbLite computed f+ over {R,K} only, but MobiDB-lite v3 states.py translation table
   maps H->positive (f+=(R+K+H)/L) — HHHHHHHHAA (f+=0.8) returned WeaklyCharged instead of
   PositivePolyelectrolyte; the 16 prior flavour tests were all His-free so the gap was invisible. Fix: added H
   to positive count, corrected docstring (translation table cited), added F5b (HHHHHHHHAA->PPE) + F5c
   (HHHHDDDDAA->Polyampholyte, H balancing D); boundaries + default RegionType/Confidence untouched. Notes
   (PASS-WITH-NOTES) = disclosed first-principles labelling heuristics (enrichment 0.25 ~5x-random NOT Das&Pappu
   NCPR, priority Pro>Acidic>Basic>S/T>Long>Standard, Confidence=(mean-0.542)/(1-0.542)) affecting labels not

   Failed 0 (Genomics 18819). New source-summary page disorder-region-001-report. SURGICALLY enriched the
   existing anchor concept intrinsic-disorder-prediction-top-idp (already hosts the DISORDER-REGION-001
   region-detection section + already linked the evidence) rather than a new concept — added the report to
   sources, bumped source_commit to 8bd6a5e1, cross-linked disorder-region-001-report + the CLEAN/one-fix
   verdict + validation-ledger in the region-detection section. Updated wiki/index.md (+1 source line). Tied to

   disorder-morf-001-report. No contradictions (the 0.25-vs-NCPR clarification is a disclosed heuristic

## [2026-07-10] lint | structural + staleness + coverage + graph pass (488→491 pages)
Ran the full lint suite. Staleness CLEAN, graph lint CLEAN (491 nodes, 0 issues). Findings triaged and fixed:
- **Broken wikilinks (4)** — false positives from escaped-pipe table cells (`[[slug\|Alias]]`) on rna-secondary-structure-prediction / rna-stem-loop-enumeration; all targets exist. Root cause was `WIKILINK_RE` in `scripts/wiki_lint.py` capturing the trailing `\` into the slug. Fixed the regex to exclude `\` from the target class and tolerate an optional leading backslash before the alias pipe (verified against all 4 flagged strings + plain-pipe / no-alias / mixed-row controls). Linter-only change; no wiki page edited for this.
- **Oversize (2)** — backlog.md (448) and algorithm-validation-evidence.md (466), both over the 400 soft cap and under the 800 hard cap; ACCEPTED as meta/hub pages (user decision), revisit near 800.
- **Coverage** — 174 uncovered → 168 (all `docs/algorithms/**`, backlog-tracked) after handling the 6 non-algorithm docs: ingested the 3 overviews (new source pages mcp-readme, skills-strategy, golden-skills-regression, cross-linked to each other + skill-layer / scientific-rigor / mcp-plan) and added 3 SCHEMA excludes for the ledgers (docs/mcp/MCP_STATUS.md, docs/mcp/traceability.md, docs/skills/golden/tasks.md). Zero non-algorithm docs now uncovered.
- Updated wiki/index.md (+3 source lines), wiki/concepts/skill-layer.md (wikilinked the strategy/golden/mcp-readme refs), and regenerated the compiled graph (491 nodes, 3734 edges).
   graph: +3 nodes (mcp-readme, skills-strategy, golden-skills-regression sources), +0 typed edges (new source pages carry mentions only; no `graph.relationships` blocks added).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | MCP tool catalog (batch, replaces per-tool ingestion)
Added `wiki/concepts/mcp-tool-catalog.md` (354 lines) — one durable reference mapping all **427 MCP tools across 11 servers** to the concept each thin wrapper delegates to (deterministic map from `tools/wiki-ingest/mcp_map.py`). Concept-grouped rows (`[[concept]] — tool_a, tool_b`) keep every tool→concept visible while staying compact; unmapped tools grouped by wrapped C# class per server. Coverage: **209 mapped / 218 unmapped**, **120 distinct concepts** referenced (all resolve; no broken wikilinks). No new concept page created — unmapped tools recorded as gaps (largest clusters: Parsers 39/41 whole-server gap, PrimerDesigner, GenomeAssemblyAnalyzer, StructuralVariantAnalyzer, RestrictionAnalyzer, RnaSecondaryStructure energy terms). Typed graph: catalog `relates_to` three-front-doors + skill-layer (both high, README-sourced). Updated wiki/index.md (+1 Concepts line).
- **Validation reports (12)** — ingested the 12 remaining `docs/Validation/reports/**` as full `[[<unit>-report]]` verdict pages (GENOMIC-REPEAT-001, META-RESIST-001, MIRNA-PAIR-001, MIRNA-TARGET-001, PANGEN-CORE-001, PARSE-GENBANK-001, PROTMOTIF-TM-001, RNA-PARTITION-001, SEQ-COMPLEX-COMPRESS-001, SV-CNV-001, SV-DETECT-001, TRANS-SPLICE-001), each wired into its existing concept (`sources:` + body wikilink) and listed under index `## Sources`; all end-state ✅ CLEAN. Complements the bulk `validation-verdicts` registry (these 12 were not in it). Also removed a stray tool-call tag block at the end of `discordant-pair-sv-detection.md`.
- **Oversize split (2)** — split the two soft-cap pages: `backlog.md` (448→149) moved its per-domain pending tables to the new [[backlog-pending]] (type index); `concepts/algorithm-validation-evidence.md` (468→376) moved its inline 190-item `[[..-evidence]]` enumeration to the new [[evidence-artifact-index]] (type synthesis, so the links still count as inbound — no evidence page orphaned). Both new pages indexed; wiki lint clean (0 oversize).

## [2026-07-11] ingest | docs/algorithms/Annotation/GFF3_IO.md → gff3-io (concept)
   New concept [[gff3-io]] synthesizing the ANNOT-GFF-001 **annotation-layer** GFF3 helper
   (`GenomeAnnotator.ParseGff3` / `ToGff3` / `EncodeGff3Value`, Implementation Status *Simplified*) —
   the second GFF3 path, kept distinct from the FileIO `GffParser` unit ([[parse-gff-001-evidence]]).
   Carries what is distinct: reduced `GenomicFeature` parse record (drops `seqid`/`source` → lossy
   round-trip), `GeneAnnotation`-only exporter, col-9 encoder, and the load-bearing **per-transcript
   cumulative CDS phase** `(3 − Σ preceding-lengths mod 3) mod 3` (5′→3′, both strands). Reused
   existing pages rather than duplicating the 9-column schema/dialect facts (on [[parse-gff-001-evidence]])
   and coordinate contrast (on [[bed-format-parsing]] / [[insdc-feature-location]]). Cross-linked from
   [[annot-gff-001-report]] (validation verdict), [[bed-format-parsing]], [[parse-gff-001-evidence]].
   Re-homed the `parse_gff3` / `to_gff3` MCP tools from [[bed-format-parsing]] onto [[gff3-io]] in
   [[mcp-tool-catalog]] (mapped 209→210, unmapped 218→217, concepts 120→121). Moved GFF3_IO from
   [[backlog-pending]] (Annotation 3→2) to [[backlog]] covered (77→78). Updated index. No contradictions.
   graph: +1 node, +1 typed edge

## [2026-07-13] ingest | docs/algorithms/Annotation/Gene_Prediction.md → prokaryotic-gene-prediction-rbs (concept, reconciliation)
   Reconciliation ingest: the primary spec was already fully synthesized by the existing concept
   [[prokaryotic-gene-prediction-rbs]] (created 2026-07-10, alongside the ANNOT-GENE-001 validation
   ingest), which lists `docs/algorithms/Annotation/Gene_Prediction.md` in `sources:` and is
   NOT stale (its `source_commit` == HEAD `ec9209f6`; the doc has no commits since). Verified the
   concept faithfully covers the doc's contract, INV-01…04, declared simplifications (no overlap/
   best-model resolution, promoter −10/−35 not integrated → [[promoter-detection]], forward-only
   legacy RBS, length-only score), SD model, complexity, and edge cases — no enrichment needed.
   Per the established project pattern, `docs/algorithms/**` primary specs are synthesized into
   concepts and cited in `sources:` rather than given a dedicated `wiki/sources/` page (no algorithm
   spec has one). Sole gap was the stale backlog (generated 2026-07-09, before the concept existed):
   moved Gene_Prediction.md from [[backlog-pending]] (Annotation 2→1) to [[backlog]] covered (78→79,
   pending 167→166). No new pages, no new graph edges, no contradictions.

## [2026-07-13] ingest | docs/algorithms/Annotation/ORF_Detection.md → [[open-reading-frame-detection]] (concept, enriched)
   Reconciliation ingest of the annotation-layer ORF primary spec (test unit ANNOT-ORF-001,
   `GenomeAnnotator.FindOrfs`). The existing concept [[open-reading-frame-detection]] already
   synthesized the sibling annotation finder (ATG/GTG/TTG starts, amino-acid `minLength`,
   `searchBothStrands`/`requireStartCodon` flags, `Translator.FindOrfs`, hard-coded standard code,
   nested-start-per-stop semantics) and cited its validation report [[annot-orf-001-report]] — but
   did NOT list the spec in `sources:` and lacked `FindLongestOrfsPerFrame`. Enriched the "sibling
   annotation ORF finder" section with `FindLongestOrfsPerFrame` (calls `FindOrfs(minLength:1)`,
   groups under signed frame keys 1..3 forward / -1..-3 reverse, longest-per-frame), default
   minLength 100, 0-based half-open `[Start,End)` span with terminal `*` retained in `ProteinSequence`,
   and pending-starts-per-frame; removed the now-false "not ingested here" note. Added
   `docs/algorithms/Annotation/ORF_Detection.md` to `sources:`, bumped `source_commit` → HEAD
   `4b5d552f`. Moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (Annotation 1→0, section removed) to [[backlog]]
   covered (79→80, pending 166→165, 27→26 domains). Per the established pattern, no dedicated
   `wiki/sources/` page for the algorithm spec. No new concept, no new graph edges, no contradictions.

## [2026-07-13] ingest | docs/algorithms/CANONICAL_MAP.md → [[canonical-algorithm-map]] (source, meta/index)
   Ingested the META/INDEX doc (not a per-algorithm spec) as ONE concise source page
   `wiki/sources/canonical-algorithm-map.md` recording the project's algorithm-identity authority:
   alias→canonical test-unit IDs (SEQ-COMPOSITION-001→SEQ-STATS-001, SEQ-TM-001→SEQ-THERMO-001,
   GENOMIC-TANDEM-001→REP-TANDEM-001), folder-bucket normalization (MolTools / Population_Genetics /
   K-mer / RnaStructure — four merges complete; Motif_Analysis/Sequence_Comparison/Genomic_Analysis/
   Extended_Annotation/Extended_Assembly pending), one-canonical-doc-per-concept rules, and the
   retained legacy/baseline methods (UPGMA, JC/K2P, chi-sq HWE, Nussinov, OLC). Cross-linked to the
   coverage/registry infrastructure: [[backlog]] (identity-vs-coverage complement),
   [[algorithms-checklist-v2]], [[algorithm-validation-evidence]], [[validation-ledger]]. Listed under
   index Sources; updated the [[backlog]] Notes row (CANONICAL_MAP now points at the new page,
   README.md remains index-only). Per the meta-doc rule: NO per-algorithm concept pages created. No
   typed graph edges (source page). No contradictions.

## [2026-07-13] ingest | docs/algorithms/Chromosome_Analysis/Higher_Order_Repeat_Detection.md → enriched [[centromere-analysis]]
   Reused the existing chromosome centromere/satellite anchor rather than creating a new page: the
   HOR method (`DetectHigherOrderRepeat`) was already synthesized there (validated as CHROM-HOR-001).
   Added the primary spec to `sources:` (source_commit → HEAD b8c0053), enriched the HOR bullet with
   genuinely-distinct spec detail: the `HorResult` record struct, `monomerLength` default/validation,
   smallest-qualifying-period rule, O(M²·L²) cost with per-pair memoisation, and the not-implemented
   cascading/nested HOR-of-HORs decomposition (HORmon / alpha-CENTAURI). Resolved the last pending
   Chromosome_Analysis backlog row: moved to Covered via concept, updated counts (80→81 covered,
   165→164 pending, 26→25 domains) and removed the section from [[backlog-pending]]. No new page,
   no new typed edges (existing chrom-hor-001-report edge already links this slice). No contradictions.

## [2026-07-13] ingest | docs/algorithms/Codon/Codon_Usage_Statistics.md → new concept [[codon-usage-statistics]]
   Created a dedicated concept for the codon-usage family's aggregation/reporting view
   (CODON-STATS-001, `CodonUsageAnalyzer.GetStatistics` + `CalculateCai`). Rationale for a new page
   rather than enrichment: the component measures (RSCU/ENC/CAI) are each owned by existing concepts,
   but the **positional-GC block (GC1/GC2/GC3, GC3s, OverallGc)** and the one-pass bundle contract are
   genuinely distinct and unowned. Page synthesizes the bundle contract + positional GC — GC3s =
   %G/C at synonymous third positions with Met/Trp/stop excluded (Peden 1999 §1.8.2.1.3, the ATGGCA
   GC3=50% vs GC3s=0% contrast), GC3s-as-percentage (100× CodonW fraction) deviation, and the
   skip-zero-w CAI note (vs the [[codon-adaptation-index]] 1e-6 clamp; bundled E.coli/Kazusa tables
   never hit it). The CODON-STATS-001 Evidence and Validation-report artifacts were already ingested
   as source pages ([[codon-stats-001-evidence]] / [[codon-stats-001-report]]); this closes the
   remaining *algorithm-spec* coverage gap. Inbound links added from [[relative-synonymous-codon-usage]]
   and [[codon-usage-comparison]] (retargeted their "aggregation view" mentions from the evidence
   source page to the concept). Moved the last pending Codon backlog row to Covered via concept;
   updated counts (81→82 covered, 164→163 pending, 25→24 domains) and removed the Codon section from
   [[backlog-pending]]. Added [[codon-usage-statistics]] to index Concepts. No contradictions.

CONTEXT check: the concept [[dust-low-complexity-score]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the SEQ-COMPLEX-DUST-001 Evidence artifact) and already synthesizes the formula, defaults (k=3, window 64, threshold 2.0/level 20), worked oracles, and corner cases. Per the ingest brief (prefer REUSE; do NOT create a redundant concept for a spec already covered), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a new page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured: entry points `CalculateDustScore(DnaSequence,int)`/`(string,int)` + `MaskLowComplexity` in `SequenceComplexity.cs`; complexity O(L·wordSize) time / O(min(L,4^wordSize)) space; the "no suffix tree used" reuse-policy note; the **normalization-bug correction** (earlier code divided by `words−1`, over-scaling; fixed to divide by the word count for the `1/(L−2)` normalization); and the **SDUST symmetric perfect-interval masking rule is NOT implemented** (MaskLowComplexity is a fixed-window threshold scan, so masked boundaries may differ from dustmasker/sdust). Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/Complexity/DUST_Score.md to sources (now spec + Evidence), source_commit→HEAD (be6d15b), updated→2026-07-13. Backlog reconciliation: moved the `docs/algorithms/Complexity/DUST_Score.md` row from [[backlog-pending]] (Complexity 4→3) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept table → [[dust-low-complexity-score]]; counts 82→83 covered, 163→162 pending. No new page ⇒ no index.md change (concept already listed). No graph change (no new nodes/edges — concept and its registry edge already exist). Sources agree with the already-recorded Evidence synthesis (Morgulis 2006, Li 2025 longdust, lh3/sdust); one new spec detail is the divisor-correction history, consistent with the `1/(L−2)` normalization already on the page — no contradictions. Follow-ups: none — the DUST algorithm is now covered by both its Evidence and its primary spec.

CONTEXT check: the concept [[k-mer-statistics]] already synthesizes this exact unit in its "Second entry point" section (created from the SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001 Evidence artifact) — formula, contract, bounds, worked oracles (ACGT k=1/k=2, ATATAT, AAAA, AAACGT) all already present. Per the ingest brief (prefer REUSE; do NOT create a redundant concept for a spec already covered), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a new `k-mer-entropy` page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured: entry points `CalculateKmerEntropy(DnaSequence,int)`/`(string,int)` → private `CalculateKmerEntropyCore(string,int)` in `SequenceComplexity.cs`; single linear scan with `Dictionary<string,int>`; complexity **O(N·k) time, O(D·k) space**; the "suffix tree evaluated and not used" reuse-policy note (mirrors DUST); the **generalization-of per-base Shannon entropy** comparison (`CalculateShannonEntropy` ≈ k=1 over 4 nt, max 2 bits, order-blind); the default **k=2** and unconstrained/no-IUPAC alphabet; and the **Not-implemented** items — normalised entropy `H/log₂N` and the entropy–rank ratio (Çakır arXiv:2511.05300), so cross-length values are not directly comparable and RC-equivalence/position are not modelled. Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/Complexity/K-mer_Entropy.md to sources (now Evidence + K-mer_Statistics spec + this spec), source_commit→HEAD (1166783), updated→2026-07-13. Backlog reconciliation: moved the `docs/algorithms/Complexity/K-mer_Entropy.md` row from [[backlog-pending]] (Complexity 3→2) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[k-mer-statistics]]; counts 83→84 covered, 162→161 pending. No new page ⇒ no index.md change (concept already listed). No graph change (no new nodes/edges — concept + registry edges already exist; the pending `shannon-entropy` reference kept as plain text, not a broken wikilink). Sources agree with the already-recorded Evidence synthesis (Li 2025 longdust, Entropy–Rank Ratio, Shannon 1948) — no contradictions.

CONTEXT check: the concept [[sequence-complexity-compression-lempel-ziv]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the SEQ-COMPLEX-COMPRESS-001 Evidence + Validation-report artifacts) and already synthesizes the parsing rule, raw-count oracles, normalization worked example, homopolymer/b<2/trailing-component corner cases, and the family placement vs DUST/k-mer-entropy/SEG/repeat-detection. Per the ingest brief (prefer REUSE; do NOT create a redundant concept for a spec already covered), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a new `lempel-ziv-complexity` page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured as a new "Implementation surface and spec cross-check" section: the three entry points `CalculateLempelZivComplexity`→int, `CalculateNormalizedLempelZivComplexity`→double, `EstimateCompressionRatio`→double thin delegate (registry-canonical name behind the `complexity_compression_ratio` MCP tool, INV-05) on `SequenceComplexity.cs` (Seqeron.Genomics.Analysis); the `HashSet<string>` single-pass factorization with the "suffix tree evaluated and not used" reuse note; complexity **O(n) amortized / O(n²) worst case, O(n) space**; and null/empty handling (null DnaSequence throws, null/empty string→0). Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/Complexity/Lempel_Ziv_Complexity.md to sources (now spec + Evidence + Validation report), source_commit→HEAD (6cc4dea), updated→2026-07-13. Backlog reconciliation: moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (Complexity 2→1) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[sequence-complexity-compression-lempel-ziv]]; counts 84→85 covered, 161→160 pending (24 domains unchanged). No new page ⇒ no index.md change (concept already listed). No graph change (no new nodes/edges — concept + its registry edge already exist). CONTRADICTION flagged on the page: the spec (last reviewed 2026-06-14) still documents the **raw count** being returned for single-symbol input (b<2), but validation (2026-07-10) corrected the code to the reference clamp-to-2 normalized value (`"0"×16 → 1.25`); the read-only spec now lags shipped behavior on that one degenerate case, validated 1.25 is authoritative. Follow-ups: none — LZ76 complexity is now covered by its spec, Evidence, and Validation report.

CONTEXT check: the concept [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the SEQ-COMPLEX-WINDOW-001 + SEQ-ENTROPY-PROFILE-001 Evidence artifacts) and already synthesizes the two per-window measures, window geometry / `ComplexityPoint` contract, worked oracles (ACGTACGT LC=23/29, AAAAAAAA LC=6/29, the L=24/w=8/s=8 → 3-window geometry), corner cases, and the second standalone Shannon-entropy-profile entry point. Per the ingest brief (prefer REUSE; do NOT create a redundant concept for a spec already covered), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a new `windowed-complexity` page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured, as a new "Implementation surface" section: entry point `CalculateWindowedComplexity(DnaSequence, windowSize=64, stepSize=10)` on `SequenceComplexity.cs` (Seqeron.Genomics.Analysis) returning a lazily-evaluated `IEnumerable<ComplexityPoint>`; delegation to the shared `CalculateShannonEntropyCore`/`CalculateLinguisticComplexityCore` helpers (window values equal the standalone scalar metrics); complexity **O((L/s)·w²) time**, per-window space bounded by distinct-subword count; the "suffix tree evaluated and rejected" reuse note; and the **Not-implemented** linear-time suffix-tree profile of Troyanskaya et al. (2002) (direct per-window enumeration is authoritative for the ≤6 bounded word lengths). Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/Complexity/Windowed_Complexity.md to sources (now spec + 2 Evidence), source_commit→HEAD (579178e), updated→2026-07-13. Backlog reconciliation: moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (Complexity 1→0, section removed) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]]; counts 85→86 covered, 160→159 pending, 24→23 domains. No new page ⇒ no index.md change (concept already listed). No graph change (no new nodes/edges — concept + its two registry edges already exist). Spec agrees with the already-recorded Evidence synthesis (Shannon 1948, Troyanskaya 2002, Gabrielian & Bolshoy 1999) — no contradictions.

CONTEXT check per brief (checked for existing GC-skew / AT-skew / strand-asymmetry / replication-origin concepts first): the concept [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the SEQ-ATSKEW-001 / SEQ-STATS-001 / SEQ-GC-ANALYSIS-001 / SEQ-REPLICATION-001 Evidence artifacts) and already synthesizes the formula, `[−1,+1]` bounds, zero-denominator⇒0.0 convention, case-insensitive/ignore-non-A/T symbol handling, worked oracles, and the strand-asymmetry biology (Lobry 1996, Charneski 2011) with cross-links to [[replication-origin-cumulative-skew]] and [[windowed-gc-profile-and-variance]]. Per the brief (AT skew is the compositional sibling of GC skew — fold into the existing concept, do NOT create a redundant page), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a new `at-skew` page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured, as a new "Implementation" section: both scalar skews live in `GcSkewCalculator` (Seqeron.Genomics.Analysis); AT skew has two overloads over a shared private core — `CalculateAtSkew(string)` (canonical; upper-cases, counts A/T via `string.Count`; null/empty⇒0) and `CalculateAtSkew(DnaSequence)` (forwards the normalized value object; null⇒ArgumentNullException); complexity **O(n) time / O(1) space**; the "suffix tree does not apply — a two-symbol count, not substring search" reuse-policy note; and the **global-scalar-only** scope (windowed/cumulative AT-skew profiles and AT-skew-based origin location deliberately not implemented → the same class's GC-skew-based `CalculateWindowedGcSkew`/`CalculateCumulativeGcSkew`/`PredictReplicationOrigin` for localization). Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/Extended_GC_Skew_Analysis/AT_Skew.md to sources (now spec + 4 Evidence), source_commit→HEAD (4beb586), updated→2026-07-13. Backlog reconciliation: moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (Extended_GC_Skew_Analysis 2→1) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[nucleotide-composition-skew]]; counts 86→87 covered, 159→158 pending (23 domains unchanged — Comprehensive_GC_Analysis still pending in the domain).

CONTEXT check per brief (checked existing GC-content/GC-skew/windowed concepts first): the concept [[windowed-gc-profile-and-variance]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the SEQ-GC-ANALYSIS-001 Evidence artifact) and already synthesizes the six outputs, formulas, window geometry (only fully-contained windows; shorter-than-window ⇒ empty lists), the ÷N population-variance choice, worked oracles (`GGGCCAT`→71.428…/0.2/0.0; `GGCC` w2s2→`GcSkewVariance` 1.0/`GcContentVariance` 0.0), and the two labelling/estimator assumptions. Per the brief (this is an aggregation/bundle folding into an existing GC concept — enrich, do NOT create a redundant page), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a `comprehensive-gc-analysis` page; exact precedent = the 2026-07-13 AT_Skew spec ingest into [[nucleotide-composition-skew]]. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured, as a new "Implementation" section: lives in `GcSkewCalculator` (Seqeron.Genomics.Analysis); one entry point two overloads over a shared core — `AnalyzeGcContent(DnaSequence, windowSize=1000, stepSize=100)` (canonical; validates non-null → `ArgumentNullException`; delegates to core) and `AnalyzeGcContent(string, …)` (parity; null/empty ⇒ zero result, empty lists, `SequenceLength=0`); the eight-field `GcAnalysisResult` record shape; window positions 0-based, `WindowStart`/`WindowEnd` inclusive, `Position`=midpoint `start+windowSize/2`, count `⌊(n−w)/step⌋+1` (INV-05); complexity **O(n + W·w) time / O(W) space** with each window recounted independently (no incremental sliding accumulator, matching the `CalculateWindowedGcSkew` cores); the suffix-tree-not-applicable reuse note (counting/aggregation only); and the out-of-scope note (no cumulative diagram / origin call — those belong to `PredictReplicationOrigin` SEQ-REPLICATION-001 / `CalculateCumulativeGcSkew`).

Per the brief (prefer REUSE; create a new page ONLY if genuinely warranted — it was not), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a redundant page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured, as two new sections: (1) "Parser surface & behavioral notes (`BedParser`)" — `Parse`/`ParseFile` O(n)/O(1), tab-first-then-whitespace(<3 fields) split, and the interval-toolkit table with the behavioral gotchas: `MergeOverlapping` O(r log r) merges *touching* intervals (`next.ChromStart <= current.ChromEnd`), `Intersect`/`Subtract` O(a·b) worst case, `ExpandIntervals` swaps upstream/downstream on negative strand, `CalculateCoverage` emits depth change-points not per-base rows, and the BED12 block helpers `ExpandBlocks`/`GetTotalBlockLength`/`GetIntrons` with exon expansion `exonStart = chromStart + blockStarts[i]`; (2) "`Auto` vs. explicit format modes" — `Auto` locks field count to the first data line (mixed-width files partially skipped), explicit `Bed3`/`Bed6`/`Bed12` do NOT currently force their nominal field count, display fields (thickStart/thickEnd/itemRgb) parsed but not semantically validated, and bigBed/full-UCSC-toolchain out of scope.

CONTEXT check per brief (there is very likely an existing Evidence-derived concept for FASTA parsing — REUSE): UNLIKE the BED/EMBL spec-ingest precedents, FASTA had **no** concept page — only the Evidence source page [[parse-fasta-001-evidence]], which had explicitly judged (from the format-facts artifact alone) that "no separate concept page is warranted." The primary spec is genuinely richer than that Evidence: it carries a full **Contract** (4 parameters, return table), **invariants INV-01/02/03**, a **complexity table**, concrete **entry points**, the **opt-in `SequenceAlphabet`/`FastaRecord` overloads** (default strict-DNA `FastaEntry`/`DnaSequence` vs opt-in `StrictDna`/`IupacNucleotide`+gap/`Rna`/`Protein`+`*` returning raw-string-preserving `FastaRecord`), and a deviations table — substantial implementation content not represented anywhere in the wiki, and the backlog explicitly expects a `fasta-parsing` slug. Per the brief ("Create a new concept page ONLY if genuinely warranted and not represented") and the FileIO per-format pattern (BED→[[bed-format-parsing]], EMBL→[[insdc-feature-location]]), CREATED the concept [[fasta-parsing]] (concepts/fasta-parsing.md). It synthesizes: the format (defline first-token=Id / rest=description, multi-line-or-single-line sequence lines with in-sequence whitespace ignored, multi-FASTA = concatenated records); the two-state line-oriented state machine (current header + `StringBuilder` buffer, emit-on-both-header-and-sequence rule at each `>`/EOF); INV-01/02/03; the `FastaParser`/`FastaEntry`/`DnaSequence` contract + entry-point/complexity tables (`Parse` O(n)/O(m), `ToFasta` O(n)/O(n), default width 80); the opt-in `SequenceAlphabet` overloads → `FastaRecord` (no `ToFasta`/`WriteFile` for the non-DNA record type); and the edge cases / intentional simplifications (null-or-empty→∅, header-without-sequence dropped, blank-line + in-sequence-whitespace skip, lowercase→upper, multi-space-defline single-leading-space, round-trip parse→write→parse). Inbound link: updated [[parse-fasta-001-evidence]] (source page) — softened its "no separate concept page is warranted" note to point the implementation surface at [[fasta-parsing]] (Evidence keeps the literature-traced format facts + character-set tables).

Finding: the k-entropy is ALREADY covered (k-mer-statistics owns `H=−Σ p log₂ p` as `AnalyzeKmers.Entropy` and `SequenceComplexity.CalculateKmerEntropy`/SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001; this spec's `KmerAnalyzer.CalculateKmerEntropy` is a THIRD entry point to the identical formula), BUT `GetKmerFrequencies` (normalized frequency vector `f_i=c_i/Σc_j`) and `GetKmerSpectrum` (count-of-counts multiplicity histogram) are genuinely distinct, unrepresented OUTPUTS — no concept owns the frequency-map or the spectrum-producer.

Deliberately does NOT re-derive the k-entropy formula, bounds, or oracles (those stay on [[k-mer-statistics]]).

ENRICHED the concept surgically: added the spec (`docs/algorithms/Metagenomics/PanGenome_Core_Accessory.md`) as the FIRST entry in `sources:`, bumped source_commit 9957b47→24019ea and updated 2026-07-10→2026-07-13, and inserted a new "Implementation (`PanGenomeAnalyzer`)" section with the genuinely-distinct impl content NOT previously on the page: entry points (`ConstructPanGenome(genomes, identityThreshold=0.9, coreFraction=0.99)`, private `CalculateGenomeFluidity`/`DeterminePanGenomeType`/`EstimateHeapsDecayExponent`), the sharp `GetCoreGeneClusters` caveat (the standalone Registry `IdentifyCoreGenes` referent uses the FLOOR rule `occupancy ≥ floor(threshold·totalGenomes)`, NOT the fractional test — can admit borderline clusters `ConstructPanGenome` rejects at small N), the k=7 k-mer Jaccard clusterer + suffix-tree-evaluated-and-not-used note, single-dictionary-order Heaps α fit (zero-novelty floored to 1) → order-dependent borderline calls, no fluidity jackknife σ², and complexity (ConstructPanGenome O(g²·s)/O(g); fluidity O(N²·C); Heaps α O(N·C)) + INV-01..07 test coverage. Did NOT re-derive the fluidity formula, occupancy rule, or Heaps criterion (already on the page). NO wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report — per spec-ingest precedent). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new graph nodes/edges (concept reused). Backlog reconciliation: moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (removed the Metagenomics section entirely, header 148→147 docs / 20→19 domains) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[pan-genome-core-accessory-partition]]; status line 98→99 covered, 148→147 pending / 21→20 domains — THE METAGENOMICS DOMAIN IS NOW FULLY COVERED. index.md unchanged (concept already registered, line 485).

CONTEXT check per brief (REUSE existing Tm / nearest-neighbor / primer-dimer / thermodynamics concepts): the concept [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] already exists (PRIMER-TM-001, created 2026-07-10) and already comprehensively synthesizes this exact algorithm — the SantaLucia unified NN model, the bimolecular Tm Eq. 3 with the x=4/x=1 symmetry factor, the Eq. 5 Na⁺ salt correction, the full `CalculateDimerThermodynamicsNtthal` DP (mismatch/loop/bulge/overhang), and the SAME worked oracles this spec gives (GCGCGCGC self → 40.0906 °C; TGCATGCATG/CATGCATGCA → 25.6596 °C; GCGCATGCGC → 43.1572 °C). The two sibling NN-Tm surfaces [[dna-duplex-nearest-neighbor-thermodynamics]] (SEQ-THERMO-001) and [[melting-temperature]] (SEQ-TM-001 Wallace/Marmur-Doty) also exist and are already cross-linked from it.

CONTEXT/decision per brief (REUSE the existing concept's hairpin section — a prior partial assessment found it already thoroughly covers this spec): the concept [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] already has an "Intramolecular hairpin self-folding" section that comprehensively synthesizes this exact spec — the reused `NnUnifiedParams` stem NN stacks, the Table 4 loop-initiation ΔG°37 by size (3→3.5 … 30→6.3) with loop ΔH°=0 / ΔS°=−ΔG°37·1000/310.15, the Jacobson-Stockmayer 2.44 large-loop extrapolation, the EXCLUDED bimolecular-init + terminal-A·T terms (unimolecular nucleation = loop init), the Eq. 11 concentration-independent Tm (Vallone & Benight 1999), the <3-nt steric floor, the tri/tetraloop bonus (now bundled via [[primer-tm-001-special-loop-evidence]]), and the SAME primary oracle GGGCTTTTGCCC → ΔH°=−25.8, ΔS°=−75.48486216346927, ΔG°37=−2.3883700000000054, Tm=68.6404 °C.

Added the spec (`docs/algorithms/MolTools/DNA_Hairpin_Folding_Tm.md`) as the 2nd entry in `sources:` (after DNA_Dimer_Tm.md), bumped source_commit d5b7080→1f9b4d8 (updated already 2026-07-13). Surgical addition to the hairpin section: the genuinely-distinct IMPLEMENTATION content the section lacked — the legacy folder signature `FindMostStableHairpin(sequence, minStemLength=2, loopBonusDeltaG37=0)`, the single-stem-one-loop restriction (no bulges/internal/multibranch), the closing-pair-scan-then-maximal-inward-extension MFE mechanic, the loop<3 / stem<minStemLength (minStemLength must be ≥2 = ≥1 NN stack) rejection, the O(n³) worst-case complexity (O(n²) closing-pair scan × O(n) extension; primers ≤~40 nt), `CalculateHairpinMeltingTemperature` returning the Eq. 11 Tm or NaN, and the `HairpinResult` record fields (StemStart/StemEnd 0-based outermost pair, StemLength, LoopSize, ΔH°/ΔS°/ΔG°37).

CONTEXT check: the concept [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] already synthesizes this exact unit in its "Intramolecular hairpin self-folding" section (built from the PRIMER-TM-001-SPECIAL-LOOP Evidence, [[primer-tm-001-special-loop-evidence]]) — the bundled 16/76 tables, bsearch keying, ΔH cal/mol / ΔS cal/(K·mol) convention, and the GGGGCGAAAGCCCC/GGGCGAAGCCC oracles are all already present.

CONTEXT/decision per brief (survey wiki/concepts for existing probe/primer/oligo concepts to REUSE; ENRICH the closest existing concept UNLESS probe design is genuinely distinct from primer design and unrepresented → then create a focused concept with ≥1 inbound link). Survey: [[taqman-probe-design-rules]] (PROBE-DESIGN-001, but scoped to the opt-in TaqMan 5'-nuclease hard rules — it treats the generic designer as "the unchanged default" and does NOT synthesize it), [[probe-offtarget-specificity-scan]] (PROBE-VALID-001, the standalone gapped-SW off-target scan), [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] / [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] (primer siblings), [[melting-temperature]]. Finding: the GENERIC hybridization-probe designer — candidate-window enumeration + the fixed additive-penalty ranking (baseline 1.0 minus GC/Tm/homopolymer/self-comp/secondary-structure/repeat/terminal-G/C penalties), application-specific defaults (Microarray/FISH/Northern/qPCR/Southern length·Tm·GC windows), tiling probes, prefix-sum GC, the suffix-tree specificity overload, and the Standard/Tiling/Antisense/LNA/MolecularBeacon probe types — is genuinely DISTINCT from primer design and essentially UNREPRESENTED (only mentioned in passing on the TaqMan page). The backlog even reserved the slug `hybridization-probe-design`. Per the brief's decision rule CREATED the concept [[hybridization-probe-design]] (concepts/hybridization-probe-design.md) rather than folding into the TaqMan page. It owns: the primer-vs-probe distinction; the 8-row additive-penalty table (score ranks heuristically, is NOT a hybridization probability); the two-regime Tm (Wallace <14 nt / salt-adjusted `81.5+16.6·log₁₀[Na⁺]+41·GC−600/N` via `CalculateSaltAdjustedTm`, not full NN); the application-defaults table; the algorithm + complexity (O(n×m) scan, prefix-sum GC O(1), CheckSpecificity O(m), DesignTilingProbes O(n)); the "specificity is a post-shortlist filter not a full rerank" sharp edge (maxProbes×5 shortlist; requireUnique=false + specificity 0 → a probe survives with final score 0); INV-01..03; edge cases; and the scope/simplifications (no thermodynamic binding model, no DB-alignment, MGB/LNA/dual-quencher chemistries not implemented — the LNA Tm-adjust is the separate PROBE-DESIGN-001 LNA variant). Deliberately did NOT re-derive the TaqMan hard rules or the off-target scan — those stay on their own pages, cross-linked. Inbound link (≥1 required): added a body [[hybridization-probe-design]] link to [[taqman-probe-design-rules]]'s "Scope" section (which already names the generic designer as the default) — a light cross-ref WITHOUT altering that page's frontmatter/source_commit (not re-synthesized from this spec).

A standalone `lna-adjusted-nearest-neighbor-tm` page would fragment the per-oligo Tm surface. Per the brief ENRICHED [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]] rather than creating a new page.

Finding: the concept's "Per-oligo design Tm and salt corrections" section already comprehensively covers this spec — the 10 NN stacks + duplex init (+0.2/−5.7) + terminal-A·T (+2.2/+6.9) + symmetry (−1.4), Eq. 3 Tm with x∈{1,4}, SantaLucia Eq. 5 (N=2·(L−1)), Owczarzy 2004 quadratic 1/Tm + Owczarzy 2008 divalent with R=√[Mg]/[Mon] regime + Ka=3×10⁴ dNTP chelation, the internal single-mismatch (DNA_IMM) + single dangling-end (DNA_DE) tables mirroring Biopython Tm_NN, default C_T=0.5 µM, the SEQ-THERMO-001 (1997 DNA_NN3) distinction, and the 35.8 °C / GCGCGC / ATGCATGC oracles. No new page warranted (per-oligo NN Tm is the existing section's core subject; a `nearestneighbor-salt-corrected-tm` page would duplicate it) — ENRICHED the concept per brief. Added the spec (`docs/algorithms/MolTools/NearestNeighbor_Salt_Corrected_Tm.md`) as the 1st `sources:` entry, bumped source_commit 59c4c07→11bded13 (updated already 2026-07-13). Surgical addition to the per-oligo section: the one genuinely-distinct implementation detail the section lacked — the spec §3.3 three-outcome PARAMETER contract, distinct from the sequence guard: `CalculateMeltingTemperatureNN`'s concentration parameters are domain-validated up front (Tm eval `R·ln(C_T/x)` and corrections `ln[Na⁺]`/`ln[Mg²⁺]` are undefined at non-positive args), so a non-positive strandConcentrationMolar (≤0/NaN), a non-positive sodiumMolar (≤0/NaN incl. zero salt whose ln(0)=−∞ would leak ≈−273.15 °C or a silent NaN), a negative magnesiumMolar, or a negative dntpMolar each throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException — every call resolves to exactly one of: a finite theory-correct Tm, a NaN sentinel (guarded non-computable sequence), or a documented ArgumentOutOfRangeException, never an undisciplined NaN/Inf leak. Did NOT re-derive the NN model, Eq. 3, the salt corrections, the mismatch/dangling-end tables, or the oracles (already on the page). NO wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report — per spec-ingest precedent). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new graph nodes/edges (concept reused; the spec supports no new typed relationship beyond the already-recorded relates_to concept:test-unit-registry via the PRIMER-TM-001-NN Evidence).

CONTEXT/decision per brief (survey wiki/concepts for existing CRISPR/guide-RNA/off-target concepts to REUSE; enrich the closest UNLESS genuinely distinct-and-unrepresented). Finding: [[crispr-guide-rna-design]] already OWNS the CRISPR off-target surface as its "Layer 3 — off-target risk scoring (CRISPR-OFF-001)" and shares the exact test unit (CRISPR-OFF-001) and doc family, but it details only the learned MIT/Hsu-Zhang 2013 and CFD (Doench 2016) models — it referenced the honest heuristic `FindOffTargets`/`CalculateSpecificityScore`/`CalculateOffTargetScore` only in one passing "unchanged; the scored models were added on top" clause. Per the brief ENRICHED that concept rather than creating a redundant `off-target-analysis` page. Added `docs/algorithms/MolTools/Off_Target_Analysis.md` as the 5th `sources:` entry, bumped source_commit 13507add→36296b48, updated 2026-07-10→2026-07-13. Surgical addition inside Layer 3: a "Honest position-weighted heuristic" paragraph capturing the genuinely-distinct content — the `FindOffTargets(guide, genome, maxMismatches=3, systemType=SpCas9)` contract (both-strand PAM scan reusing Layer-0 geometry, yield on `0 < mismatches ≤ maxMismatches`; ArgumentNullException / ArgumentOutOfRangeException on maxMismatches∉[0,5] / ArgumentException on guide-length≠system); the hit record (Position/Sequence/Mismatches/MismatchPositions 0-based/IsForwardStrand/OffTargetScore); the **5-per-seed / 2-per-non-seed** positional penalty with the seed as the **12 bp PAM-proximal window** (last-12 Cas9/SaCas9, first-12 Cas12a) — flagged as a THIRD distinct notion of "seed" on this surface vs Layer-1's 10-nt design seed and the MIT/CFD 20-position vector; the documented subset systems table (SpCas9 NGG/20, SaCas9 NNGRRT/21, Cas12a TTTV/23); `CalculateSpecificityScore` using a **fixed mismatch cap of 4** (independent of the FindOffTargets default 3), summing penalties, returning `max(0, 100 − totalPenalty)`; INV-01 exact matches excluded / INV-02 mismatch bound / INV-03 clamp [0,100] (no off-targets ⇒ 100); and the scope limits (strict single-PAM matching misses alternate-PAM off-targets unless modeled as own system e.g. SpCas9-NAG; mismatches only, no bulges/gaps; no chromatin), with the spec's explicit redirect to CalculateCfdScore / CalculateMit* for published scoring.

CONTEXT/decision per brief (the concept [[crispr-guide-rna-design]] already OWNS the CRISPR surface — PAM detection is its "Layer 0 — PAM site detection (CRISPR-PAM-001)" — REUSE it; verify coverage, enrich only genuinely-distinct implementation content, add the doc to sources; do NOT create a dedicated wiki/sources/ page for a spec). Finding: Layer 0 already comprehensively synthesizes this spec — the 7-system PAM/IUPAC/orientation/guide-len table, both-strand scan, IupacHelper.MatchesIupac (NC-IUB 1984), 0-based Position = forward-strand PAM start with reverse Position = len−i−pamLen + reverse-complemented PamSequence, the `targetStart ≥ 0 && targetEnd < len` boundary check, the reverse-strand TargetStart coordinate caveat (CrisprDesigner.cs:1035–1041), and a worked SpCas9 oracle.

Surgical addition (one paragraph at the end of Layer 0): the genuinely-distinct content the section lacked — the explicit spacer-interval FORMULAS per orientation (PAM-after-target Cas9: targetStart = PamPos − guideLength, targetEnd = PamPos − 1; PAM-before-target Cas12a/CasX: targetStart = PamPos + pamLength, targetEnd = targetStart + guideLength − 1); the full `PamSite` output record (Position/PamSequence/TargetSequence/TargetStart/IsForwardStrand + resolved `System` metadata: name, PAM pattern, guide length, orientation, description); the O(n) time / O(k) yielded-sites space complexity; the overload contract distinction on INVALID input (DnaSequence throws ArgumentNullException on null vs the string overload returning empty for null/empty and upper-casing before scanning — for valid input both yield identical sites, refining the page's prior "identical results" phrasing); and the spec §5.3 scope note (sequence-pattern detector over the fixed 7-system table only — no cleavage-efficiency / chromatin / unlisted-Cas discovery).

CONTEXT/decision per brief (survey wiki/concepts for existing primer-design / Primer3 / primer-selection concepts to REUSE; ENRICH the closest UNLESS genuinely distinct-and-unrepresented). Finding: the concept [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] ALREADY EXISTS (created 2026-07-10 from the PRIMER-TM-001 Evidence) and IS this exact algorithm — it already comprehensively synthesizes the p_obj_fn weighted-sum formula, the `|Tm−60|+|len−20|` default collapse (opt_size=20, opt_tm=60, temp/length weights 1, GC/self/num_ns weights 0, the `DEFAULT_OPT_GC_PERCENT=PR_UNDEFINED_INT_OPT` header-vs-manual-50 subtlety), sign-gated / weight-zero-short-circuit / non-negative / penalty=0-at-optimum structural properties, self_any/self_end as caller-supplied dpal inputs, and the worked oracles ((60,20)→0, (63,20)→3, (57,18)→5, (62.5,22)→4.5, plus non-default-weight cases).

Surgical addition: a new "## Scope: which Primer3 terms this reproduces" section capturing the genuinely-distinct spec content the Evidence-derived page lacked — that the implementation reproduces only the SIX core left/right-primer terms as a deterministic O(1) exact weighted sum (not heuristic/probabilistic), with everything else deliberately OUT of scope: not-implemented per-primer terms (`*_TH` thermodynamic-alignment branch + `temp_cutoff`, `pos_penalty`, `end_stability`, `seq_quality`, `repeat_sim`, `template_mispriming`) and the entire pair-level `PRIMER_PAIR_*` objective (Tm-difference, product size, pair complementarity) — all default weight 0 so the DEFAULT selection still matches Primer3 exactly, the gap only appearing when a caller enables an unsupported weight; plus the legacy convenience `Score`/`CalculatePrimerScore` (used by `EvaluatePrimer`/`DesignPrimers`) kept UNCHANGED alongside the new validated `CalculatePrimer3Penalty`, and the Tm-term input coming from the SEQ-THERMO-001 routine ([[melting-temperature]] cross-link).

- 2026-07-13 — ingest docs/algorithms/MolTools/Primer_Design.md (PCR primer-pair design algorithm SPEC, unit PRIMER-DESIGN-001, `PrimerDesigner.DesignPrimers`). CONTEXT/decision per brief: surveyed the three sibling primer concepts ([[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]], [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]], [[hybridization-probe-design]]); the end-to-end primer-PAIR design PIPELINE is genuinely distinct and unrepresented — the penalty page explicitly defers pair ranking as "a separate (future) concern", the dimer page is thermodynamics only, and the probe page is a different reagent. Created a focused new concept [[primer-design]] (backlog already anticipated the `primer-design` slug). Content: the four-stage pipeline (search regions ≤200 bp up/downstream → candidate generation with reverse-complement-before-scoring → greedy independent per-side selection by the legacy additive `CalculatePrimerScore` heuristic → pair compatibility `|Tm_f−Tm_r|≤5 °C AND !HasPrimerDimer`), ProductSize formula (INV-03), the key distinction that DesignPrimers ranks with the legacy 100-based higher-is-better Score and NOT the validated lower-is-better [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] `CalculatePrimer3Penalty`, DefaultParameters (18–25 bp/40–60 % GC/57–63 °C/OptimalTm 60/MaxHomopolymer 4/…), contract+invariants INV-01/02/03, O(n²) complexity, and the simplifications (greedy not global, fixed heuristic, no genome-wide specificity) + the accepted 57–63 vs 55–65 °C Tm deviation. Cross-links all three MolTools siblings + hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]]. Inbound link added surgically to [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] (its pair-level scope note now points to [[primer-design]] as the pipeline handling that deferred concern). NO wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report). Registered in index.md Concepts. Backlog: moved MolTools/Primer_Design.md to Covered-via-concept, removed from [[backlog-pending]] (MolTools 6→5), adjusted counts (pending 136→135). Added 2 typed relates_to graph edges (→primer3-weighted-penalty-objective, →primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm), both explicitly source-supported.

CONTEXT/decision per brief (survey primer concepts, REUSE closest — [[primer-design]], [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]], [[primer3-weighted-penalty-objective]] — enrich unless genuinely distinct + unrepresented). Finding: PRIMER-STRUCT-001 is a DISTINCT test unit — the boolean/scalar **screening** surface that deliberately "exposes discrete boolean or scalar quality signals rather than a full thermodynamic folding model", i.e. the low-fidelity ALTERNATIVE to the ntthal thermodynamic-Tm engine (PRIMER-TM-001, [[primer-dimer-thermodynamics-tm]]) and the per-candidate screens [[primer-design]]'s `EvaluatePrimer` consumes. No owning concept existed (primer-design only names the methods as inputs; the thermo concept explicitly is the full-fidelity path and contrasts itself against boolean screens); the 3′-stability step even uses a DISTINCT SantaLucia-1998 ΔG table, not the 2004 NnUnifiedParams. Per brief (create a focused concept when genuinely distinct + unrepresented) CREATED [[primer-structure-qc-screens]] (concepts/primer-structure-qc-screens.md), owning: the five-method table + thresholds (minStemLength=4/minLoopLength=3/minComplementarity=4), the length-dispatched hairpin strategy table + INV-01, the terminal-3′-window dimer rule (last min(8,len1,len2) bases vs revcomp), the SantaLucia-1998 3′-stability ΔG table + terminal-init (+0.98 G·C/+1.03 A·T) + INV-02 + GCGCG/TATAT extremes, the run heuristics INV-03/04, and the scope note (no full thermo folding; the thermo sibling is the separate PRIMER-TM-001 unit).

- 2026-07-14 — ingest docs/algorithms/MolTools/Probe_Validation.md (Probe Validation algorithm SPEC, unit PROBE-VALID-001, `ProbeDesigner.ValidateProbe`). CONTEXT/decision per brief: REUSED the existing concept [[probe-offtarget-specificity-scan]] (the gapped Smith–Waterman opt-in scan is the improvement layered on this same unit) rather than create a new page. Enriched it with the genuinely-distinct DEFAULT `ValidateProbe(probe, references, maxMismatches=3, selfComplementarityThreshold=0.3)` surface it lacked: the specificity-score multiplicity penalty (h==0→0, h==1→1, h>1→1/h), pooled default OffTargetHits (on/off separation only in ScanOffTargetsGapped), self-complementarity fraction vs threshold, always-run hairpin secondary-structure flag, IsValid rule (no issues OR OffTargetHits≤1 && SelfComplementarity≤0.4), empty-probe structured-invalid vs null-throws behaviour, and the `CheckSuffix`/`CheckSpecificity(probe, ISuffixTree)` O(m) exact-hit helper. Clarified the default ValidateProbe is ungapped-Hamming and the SW scan is an opt-in supplement (behaviour unchanged). Added the spec to sources:, bumped source_commit→f54e8240. NO wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report).

CONTEXT/decision: NEW focused concept [[restriction-digest-simulation]] rather than enriching the existing [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]] — digest simulation is a genuinely distinct operation (partitions a **target sequence** into fragments, builds a restriction map, tests end compatibility) vs. filtering's **enzyme-library metadata selection** scope. The filtering concept itself already flagged digest as a separate not-yet-ingested RESTR unit, so the two are siblings, not one page. Considered a shared `restriction-enzyme-analysis` home for all three MolTools restriction specs but rejected: filtering (library selection), digest (sequence→fragments), and site-detection (locate cuts) are three distinct algorithm surfaces, each warranting its own concept; the filtering anchor already exists as its own page. New page synthesizes: forward-strand-cut half-open partition `[0,c1),…,[ck,L)` → k+1 fragments (palindromic sites not double-counted), the fragment-sum invariant (Σ lengths = L, gel-checkable), DigestSummary (descending sizes), RestrictionMap (per-enzyme grouped positions, UniqueCutters/NonCutters, zero-enzymes→full-catalog scan), the AreCompatible blunt/overhang truth table (BamHI+BglII GATC / EcoRV+SmaI blunt / EcoRI+PstI not) + symmetry, no-cut→single-fragment / boundary-null-enzyme / no-zero-length edge cases, and the Simplified-scope limits (no gel migration / partial digest / methylation / circular DNA). Inbound link added from [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]] (its "Relation to the rest of MolTools" section now links the digest sibling). sources: the spec path; source_commit 0f959309. NO wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report). index.md: added concept entry after [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]].

CONTEXT check per brief: the concept [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]] already exists (created 2026-07-10 from the RESTR-FILTER-001 Evidence artifact) and already synthesizes the two filter axes, the total blunt/sticky partition (INV-01), inclusive-range/boundary/empty-interval behavior, worked enzyme examples, and the SfiI interrupted-palindrome exclusion — but its `sources:` listed only the Evidence doc (so the spec row was still pending). Per the brief (REUSE the existing concept — do NOT create a new page or a `wiki/sources/` page for the spec), ENRICHED the existing concept rather than creating a redundant page. Added the doc's distinct **implementation surface** not previously captured, as a new "Implementation surface" section: the four total (never-throw, never-null) entry points on `RestrictionAnalyzer` (`Seqeron.Genomics.MolTools`, `RestrictionAnalyzer.cs`); the fixed static `Dictionary<string,RestrictionEnzyme>` library with per-record `RecognitionLength` and record-derived `IsBluntEnd` (`CutPositionForward == CutPositionReverse`), classifying end type from stored cut positions rather than re-deriving cleavage from sequence; lazy LINQ `Where` ⇒ deferred `IEnumerable<>` (insertion order; materialize with `ToList()`); complexity **O(e) time / O(1) extra space** single linear pass with the "suffix tree evaluated and inapplicable — no text to search" reuse note; and the **Not-implemented** overhang-direction (5'/3') / overhang-sequence filtering (use `AreCompatible` / `FindCompatibleEnzymes` on [[restriction-digest-simulation]]). Frontmatter: added docs/algorithms/MolTools/Restriction_Enzyme_Filtering.md to sources (now spec + Evidence), source_commit→HEAD (6a76515), updated→2026-07-14. Backlog reconciliation: moved the row from [[backlog-pending]] (MolTools 2→1) to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]]; pending pointer count 132→131 (18 domains unchanged — Restriction_Site_Detection still pending in MolTools). No new page ⇒ no index.md change (concept already listed). No graph change (no new nodes/edges — concept + its test-unit-registry edge already exist; spec adds no new typed edges). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub, per prior spec-ingest precedent). Spec agrees with the already-recorded Evidence synthesis (Wikipedia "Restriction enzyme" / "Sticky and blunt ends" / "List of restriction enzyme cutting sites", NEB/REBASE KpnI/EcoRI, PMC SfiI interrupted palindrome) — no contradictions. Follow-ups: the sibling `docs/algorithms/MolTools/Restriction_Site_Detection.md` (expected slug `restriction-site-detection`) remains the one pending row in the MolTools domain.

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/MolTools/Restriction_Site_Detection.md → restriction-site-detection (concept)
   Created the RESTR family's **location** primitive concept — given a sequence + enzyme, find
   where the recognition sequence occurs and where it cuts. Distinct from its two siblings:
   [[restriction-enzyme-filtering]] (enzyme selection, no sequence) and
   [[restriction-digest-simulation]] (fragmentation, consumes the forward-strand cut positions
   detection produces). Both-strand IUPAC scan, cut-position formulas, palindrome double-report,
   overhang classification, RestrictionSite contract + invariants. Added inbound wikilinks from
   both sibling concepts (surgical). Moved the backlog row to *Covered via concept*; removed the
   MolTools section from [[backlog-pending]] — this CLOSES the MolTools domain (113 covered / 131
   pending across 17 domains). No typed graph edges (spec cites no cross-unit relationship beyond
   the sibling mentions, which auto-derive). No contradictions.

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Allele_Specific_Copy_Number_Derivation.md → allele-specific-copy-number-ascat (concept, enriched)
   FIRST Oncology *algorithm-spec* reconciled (the domain's concept pages were all synthesized
   from Evidence docs, so every Oncology spec row was still pending). CONTEXT check: the concept
   [[allele-specific-copy-number-ascat]] (created 2026-07-09 from the ONCO-ASCAT-001 Evidence
   artifact) already synthesizes this exact unit — ASCAT nA/nB inversion + grid GoF, ASPCF
   penalised-LS segmentation, Battenberg two-state subclonal, and McGranahan/PICTograph/DeCiFering
   multiplicity+CCF. Per brief, ENRICHED it rather than create a redundant page. Added the primary
   spec's distinct surface not previously captured: (1) the reported minor-allele GoF vs the
   *selection* objective (adds the major-allele integer distance and breaks exact ties toward the
   lower ploidy ψ — the 2n-vs-4n parsimony convention); (2) the `OncologyAnalyzer` implementation
   surface — the dual segmentation path (greedy `SegmentAlleleSpecific` O(L) retained as an accepted
   deviation alongside global-optimum `SegmentAlleleSpecificAspcf` O(L²)/chrom), plus
   `FitPurityPloidy`/`DeriveMultiplicity`/`FitSubclonalCopyNumber`, and the *Simplified* status
   (fixed-grid fit, two-adjacent-state subclonal, no asmultipcf/WGD refit). Frontmatter: added the
   spec to sources (now spec + Evidence), source_commit→77e902ee, updated→2026-07-14. NO wiki/sources/

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Cancer_Cell_Fraction_Estimation.md → cancer-cell-fraction-clonal-clustering (concept, enriched)
   Second Oncology *algorithm-spec* reconciled. CONTEXT check: the concept
   [[cancer-cell-fraction-clonal-clustering]] (created 2026-07-09 from the ONCO-CCF-001 Evidence
   artifact) already synthesizes this exact unit — the McGranahan/Zheng/Tarabichi CCF closed form
   `CCF = f·(ρ·N_T + 2(1−ρ))/(ρ·m)`, the [0,1] reported cap with exposed RawCcf, and the
   deterministic Lloyd 1D k-means with quantile seeding + highest-centroid clonal rule. Per brief,
   ENRICHED it rather than create a redundant page. Added the primary spec's distinct implementation
   surface not previously captured: the two `OncologyAnalyzer` entry points with return shapes
   (`CcfEstimate.Ccf`/`RawCcf`; `CcfClustering.Centroids`/`Assignments` in input order/
   `ClonalClusterIndex`=k−1), their complexities (EstimateCcf O(1); ClusterCcfValues O(n·k·i) +
   O(n log n) sort, O(n+k) space), the exact exception types on each precondition, the quantile
   seed (j+0.5)/k and lower-index tie-break, and the suffix-tree-not-applicable note. Frontmatter:
   added the spec to sources (now spec + Evidence), source_commit→a78f8c60, updated→2026-07-14. NO
   wiki/sources/ page created (spec, not an Evidence/Validation report). No new page ⇒ no index.md

   enrichment; the concept's existing typed edges are unchanged; body wikilinks provide mentions
   edges) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Cancer_Variant_Annotation.md → [[cancer-variant-tier-classification-amp-asco-cap]] (concept enrich)
   Oncology reconciliation: the AMP/ASCO/CAP four-tier concept already existed (synthesized from

   Surgical enrich: new "Implementation surface (ONCO-ANNOT-001 spec)" section — CancerVariantAnnotationInput
   record fields, the three entry-point signatures with per-op complexity (O(1) classify / O(n) annotate /
   O(1) COSMIC lookup), the BenignPopulationMafThreshold=0.01 constant, ordinal COSMIC key equality +
   MatchCancerHotspots caller-supplied-set reuse, and the suffix-tree-not-applicable note. No wiki/sources/
   page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged (concept already listed).
   Backlog: added Covered-via-concept row (covered 115→116, pending 129→128); removed from
   [[backlog-pending]] (Oncology 35→34). No new graph nodes/edges (implementation prose only; the concept's
   existing typed edges are unchanged; body wikilinks provide mentions edges) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped.
   Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions:
   the spec and the already-recorded Evidence synthesis agree on tiers, the 1% cutoff, and III↔IV discrimination.

   Oncology reconciliation: the OncoKB therapeutic-levels concept already existed (synthesized from
   ONCO-ACTION-001-Evidence). Added the primary spec to its sources: and bumped source_commit to HEAD.
   Surgical enrich: new "Implementation surface (ONCO-ACTION-001 spec)" section — the five OncologyAnalyzer
   entry points (AssessActionability O(n·k) / ClassifyActionabilityLevel O(k) / GetTherapyRecommendations
   O(k log k) / CompareLevels O(1) / IsStandardCare O(1)), the OncoKbLevel enum integer-order encoding of

   VariantActionabilityInput null-vs-empty associations contract, the four output fields
   (Highest{Sensitive,Resistance,Combined}Level + IsActionable), and the suffix-tree-not-applicable /
   Framework-status notes. No wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report). No new page ⇒

   nodes/edges (implementation prose only; the concept's existing typed edges are unchanged; body wikilinks
   provide mentions edges) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged
   (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions: the spec and the already-recorded Evidence
   synthesis agree on the seven levels, the three ordering axes, and the NotActionable empty-level semantics.

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Clonal_Hematopoiesis_Filtering.md → [[clonal-hematopoiesis-cfdna-filtering]] (concept enrich)
   Oncology reconciliation: the CHIP-filtering concept already existed (ONCO-CHIP-001, synthesized from
   ONCO-CHIP-001-Evidence) and already covers the full primary spec — the three methods (IdentifyCHIPVariants,
   FilterCHIP with matched-WBC rule a + gene+VAF fallback rule b, CallVariantOrigin strict Bolton rule), the
   VAF≥0.02 threshold, the {DNMT3A,TET2,ASXL1,TP53,JAK2,SF3B1,SRSF2,PPM1D} panel, the φ=2.0/1.5 fold ratio,
   and matching worked oracles. Added the primary spec (docs/algorithms/Oncology/Clonal_Hematopoiesis_Filtering.md)
   as the FIRST entry in sources: (ahead of the Evidence doc), bumped source_commit 90f75a1→f0c2c13 and
   updated 2026-07-09→2026-07-14. Surgical enrich: new "Entry points and implementation" block capturing the
   spec's genuinely-distinct implementation content not previously on the page — all four static
   OncologyAnalyzer methods incl. the fourth IsCanonicalChipGene predicate, ChipVariant/WbcObservation record
   shapes, exact (chrom,1-based pos,ref,alt) locus key, the HashSet WBC-loci membership + Dictionary
   locus→best-observation data structures, O(n·g) / O(n+w) linear complexity, the suffix-tree-not-used note,
   and input-order preservation. No wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report). No new page ⇒

   nodes/edges (implementation prose only; the concept's existing typed edges are unchanged; body wikilinks

   (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions: the spec and the already-recorded Evidence
   synthesis agree on the three methods, all thresholds, the driver-gene panel, and the origin-call semantics.

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Clonal_Subclonal_Classification.md → [[clonal-subclonal-classification-ccf-posterior]] (concept enrich)
   Oncology reconciliation: the CCF-posterior clonal/subclonal concept already existed (ONCO-CLONAL-001,
   synthesized from ONCO-CLONAL-001-Evidence) and already covers the full primary spec — the expected-VAF
   relation f(c)=αMc/(2(1−α)+αq) (Landau M=1 + Satas/DeCiFering multiplicity-general form), the uniform-prior
   Binomial posterior on the 100-point grid c∈[0.01,1], the verbatim classification rule clonal iff
   P(CCF>0.95)>0.5, the strict CCF>0.95 IdentifyClonalMutations threshold, the per-variant q-over-ploidy-scalar
   assumption, and matching worked oracles (A1/B2/C1/D/E). Added the primary spec
   (docs/algorithms/Oncology/Clonal_Subclonal_Classification.md) as the FIRST entry in sources: (ahead of the
   Evidence doc), bumped source_commit 7309394→9a7b5ef and updated 2026-07-09→2026-07-14. Surgical enrich: new
   "Implementation (ONCO-CLONAL-001 spec)" block capturing the spec's genuinely-distinct implementation content
   not previously on the page — OncologyAnalyzer.cs entry points ClassifyClonality(variants,purity) /
   IdentifyClonalMutations(ccfValues), the log-space Binomial with C(N,a) omitted (cancels under
   normalisation), the degenerate all-zero-posterior → flat-posterior fallback (stays subclonal), the
   suffix-tree-not-used note, and O(n·G)/O(n) + O(m) complexity. No wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠
   Evidence/Validation report). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged (concept already listed). Backlog: added
   Covered-via-concept row (covered 118→119, pending 126→125); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Oncology

   No contradictions: the spec and the already-recorded Evidence synthesis agree on the model, both thresholds
   (0.95 CCF / 0.5 posterior), the grid, and the point-estimate variant.

## [2026-07-14] ingest | docs/algorithms/Oncology/Complex_Rearrangement_Classification.md → enriched [[chromothripsis-inference]]
   Oncology reconciliation (spec ≠ Evidence, so NO wiki/sources/ page). The concept synthesized earlier from
   ONCO-SV-001-Evidence already covered the spec's model (six hallmark criteria, oscillation counting +
   two-state hallmark, ≥10 first-pass screen, ≥6 SV floor, ≥7/4–6 confidence tiers, exponential-null CV>1
   clustering). Added the spec to sources: and bumped source_commit → ff6a38af. Surgical str_replace added a
   genuinely-distinct "Implementation (OncologyAnalyzer)" section: three entry points
   (CountCopyNumberStateOscillations / TestBreakpointClustering / ClassifyComplexRearrangement), complexity
   (O(n), O(m log m)), output-record fields, the six named decision constants, the k-transitions→k+1-segments
   rule, and the criteria-A/B-only gate (C–F / chromoplexy / BFB out of scope; suffix tree N/A). No new page ⇒

- 2026-07-14 — ingest docs/algorithms/Oncology/Copy_Number_Alteration_Classification.md (Copy-Number Alteration Classification SPEC — the primary per-algorithm spec for `OncologyAnalyzer.Log2RatioToCopyNumber`/`CallCopyNumber`/`ClassifyCopyNumber`/`ClassifyCopyNumbers`, unit ONCO-CNA-001, status Production; log2 copy ratio → absolute CN → five discrete CNA states via CNVkit hard thresholds). CONTEXT/decision per Oncology reconciliation brief: REUSED the existing concept [[copy-number-alteration-classification]] (created 2026-07-09 from the ONCO-CNA-001 Evidence artifact) rather than create a new page or a wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). The concept already covered the model (n=2·2^log2, absolute_threshold binning, default cutoffs, GISTIC2 corroboration, NaN/boundary/purity corner cases, diploid-reference assumption, docs-vs-source threshold note); its sources: listed only the Evidence doc, keeping the spec row PENDING. Enriched with a genuinely-distinct "Implementation surface (ONCO-CNA-001)" section the Evidence page lacked: the four OncologyAnalyzer entry points (continuous / integer / full CopyNumberCall / order-and-length-preserving batch), the CopyNumberCall record fields, the validation contract (thresholds exactly-four strictly-ascending non-NaN → ArgumentException; ploidy>0 → ArgumentOutOfRangeException; null batch → ArgumentNullException; null thresholds → default fallback), and O(1)/O(m) complexity plus the single-region (no segmentation / no allele-specific) scope. Added the spec to sources: (now spec + Evidence), bumped source_commit→1555a132, updated→2026-07-14. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[copy-number-alteration-classification]] (covered 120→121, pending 124→123); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Oncology 30→29, pending-total 123→122). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged (concept already listed). No new graph nodes/edges (implementation prose only; concept's existing relates_to test-unit-registry edge and body wikilinks unchanged) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions: spec and the recorded Evidence synthesis agree on the model, thresholds, and state mapping.
## [2026-07-15] ingest | docs/algorithms/PanGenome/Phylogenetic_Marker_Selection.md → enriched [[phylogenetic-marker-selection]] (closes PanGenome domain)
   PanGenome reconciliation (spec ≠ Evidence, so NO wiki/sources/ page). The concept synthesized earlier from
   PANGEN-MARKER-001-Evidence already covered the model (single-copy core marker rule per panX "all strains
   represented exactly once" / Roary 99% core + paralog filtering; parsimony-informative-site criterion per
   Zvelebil & Baum 2008 = ≥2 states each in ≥2 rows; descending-PIS ranking capped at maxMarkers; the 5-column
   PIS=2 oracle; single-copy-core selection oracle; equal-length-members alignment assumption; recombination
   caveat). Added the spec to sources: (now spec + Evidence), bumped source_commit→520d54c9, updated→2026-07-15.
   Surgical Edit added a genuinely-distinct "Implementation (per the algorithm spec)" section the Evidence-derived
   concept lacked: PanGenomeAnalyzer entry points CountParsimonyInformativeSites / SelectPhylogeneticMarkers
   (defaults maxMarkers=100), the null/<2-rows/unequal-length→0 and case-sensitive no-T↔U-normalization contract,
   the single-copy-core filter (GenomeCount==totalGenomes ∧ GeneIds.Count==totalGenomes) with ordinal-cluster-id
   tie-break, INV-01…INV-07 formalization, O(r·L)/O(n·g) complexity with the suffix-tree-not-applicable note, and
   the removed unsourced identity-band/consensus-length heuristic (Deviation/fix). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged
   (concept already listed). Backlog: added Covered-via-concept row (covered 151→152, pending 92→91, domains 16→15);
   removed the PanGenome section from [[backlog-pending]] (pending-per-domain 91→90) and added a "PanGenome domain
   now fully covered" closure note to both [[backlog]] and [[backlog-pending]], consistent with the K-mer /
   Metagenomics / MolTools / Oncology closures. No new graph nodes/edges (implementation prose only; concept's
   existing typed edges to test-unit-registry / pan-genome-gene-clustering / pan-genome-core-accessory-partition /
   ortholog-detection-reciprocal-best-hits and body wikilinks unchanged) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub
   [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions: spec and the
   recorded Evidence synthesis agree on the model, criterion, invariants, and worked datasets.

## [2026-07-15] ingest | docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/Exact_Pattern_Search.md → new [[exact-pattern-search]]
   Pattern_Matching reconciliation (spec ≠ Evidence, so NO wiki/sources/ page). Created a focused NEW concept for
   PAT-EXACT-001 rather than reusing — the spec documents the suffix-tree exact-search *engine layer* (the three
   `SuffixTree` primitives Contains/CountOccurrences/FindAllOccurrences + the MotifFinder.FindExactMotif /
   GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif DNA wrappers), genuinely distinct from the existing motif/repeat concepts that merely
   *drive* that engine. Captured: the suffix-tree characterisation (P occurs at i iff P prefixes suffix at i), the
   complexity table (Contains O(m), CountOccurrences O(m) via precomputed LeafCount, FindAllOccurrences O(m+z), build
   O(n)), INV-01/02/03, the empty-pattern core-vs-wrapper split (core `""`→occurs-everywhere/`[0..n-1]`, null→
   ArgumentNullException; wrappers guard null/empty→empty), the FindExactMotif-sorts-vs-FindMotif-unsorted ordering
   divergence, the SIMD/thread-static/LeafCount impl notes, and the banana/mississippi/GATATAT oracles. ≥1 inbound
   link satisfied: added links from [[known-motif-search]] (its GenomicAnalyzer.FindMotif is one of the two wrappers)
   and [[longest-repeated-substring]] (same repository SuffixTree). New page ⇒ index.md concepts count 214→215 and a
   concepts.md shard entry added. Backlog: added Covered-via-concept row (covered 154→155, pending 89→88); removed the
   Exact_Pattern_Search row from [[backlog-pending]] Pattern_Matching (5→4) and header total (88→87). No typed graph
   edges (the spec supports only exact-engine descriptions already carried as body wikilinks; no source-backed typed
   predicate to add) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not
   added to the hub). No contradictions with [[known-motif-search]]/[[longest-repeated-substring]]: the wrappers and
   suffix-tree semantics agree; this concept is the shared primitive beneath them.

   Oncology reconciliation (spec ≠ Evidence, so NO wiki/sources/ page). The concept synthesized earlier from

   recurrent-missense → Oncogene, f_TSG > 0.20 truncating → TSG, strict `>`, ≥2 recurrence per Miller 2017,
   dual-pass dominant-fraction tie-break → Ambiguous, IDH1/dispersed-truncating oracles, companion ops
   MatchCancerHotspots / ScoreDriverPotential=max(f) / IdentifyDriverMutations⊆input). Added the spec to
   sources: (now spec + Evidence), bumped source_commit → a9f32c33, updated → 2026-07-14. Surgical str_replace
   added a genuinely-distinct "Implementation (per the algorithm spec)" section the Evidence-derived concept
   lacked: OncologyAnalyzer.cs location + four entry points, input-order preservation, 1-based per-position
   recurrence dictionary, ordinal (case-sensitive) gene match, O(1) (gene,position) hotspot set lookup with the
   suffix-tree-not-applicable note, ArgumentNullException on null inputs, and O(N) complexity (space O(P) /
   O(G+H)). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged (concept already listed). Backlog: added Covered-via-concept row
   (covered 122→123, pending 122→121); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Oncology 28→27, total 121→120). No new
   graph nodes/edges (implementation prose only; concept's existing relates_to test-unit-registry edge and body
   wikilinks unchanged) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs

No hard contradiction; NOTE a benign framing nuance: the spec's §5.3 "intentionally simplified" describes AGFusion's "in-frame (with mutation)" middle class as mapped to InFrame (native-frame mid-codon junction, (b−p) mod 3 == 0), while the Evidence-derived concept describes the frameshifted-3′ complement case mapped to OutOfFrame ((b−p) mod 3 != 0) — these are two distinct junction geometries both handled correctly by the single codon-phase rule, not a rule disagreement.

- 2026-07-14 — lint | fixed 16 graph-provenance findings (5 typed edges re-sourced to existing source pages; 11 unsupported low-value typed edges removed while body wikilinks retain mentions), sharded the 547-line flat index into 6 bounded indexes, updated [[SCHEMA]], and rebuilt the graph (523 nodes / 4162 edges). Structural lint and graph lint clean.

- 2026-07-14 — lint follow-up | restored the 11 previously removed typed relationships at user request and rebuilt the graph (523 nodes / 4173 edges). The 5 provenance re-sources remain fixed; graph lint intentionally reports the restored 11 relationships because their `source:` values name concept pages rather than source pages.

CONTEXT/decision per the pattern-matching reconciliation brief: a prior survey found NO existing edit-distance concept — the Hamming sibling [[approximate-pattern-matching-mismatches]] (PAT-APPROX-003/001) explicitly excludes indels and pointed to a homeless "edit-distance family". So CREATED a new focused concept [[edit-distance]] synthesizing this primary spec (recurrence + two-row O(m·n)/O(n) DP, INV-01..03 + the d≤Hamming equal-length bridge, the `EditDistance` case-sensitive vs `FindWithEdits` uppercased/case-insensitive split, the p−e…p+e window band that absorbs indels, `MismatchType` Substitution-vs-Edit, the O(s·(2e+1)·p·(p+e)) search cost, the `DnaSequence` no-null-guard sharp edge, and the three deliberate simplifications: no traceback / brute-force scan / no Damerau transpositions; `kitten→sitting=3` oracle). Deliberately NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report). Added ≥1 inbound link from the Hamming page (two: intro "edit-distance / alignment family" + Scope "for indel-tolerant matching use [[edit-distance]]"), and bumped that page's source_commit→1ab8b7c1. Cross-linked [[global-alignment-needleman-wunsch]] (metric dual / unit-cost NW), [[semi-global-alignment-fitting]], [[test-unit-registry]], hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]]. sources: the spec only; source_commit 1ab8b7c1, created/updated 2026-07-15. index.md concepts count 213→214; concepts.md shard entry added. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[edit-distance]] (covered 153→154, pending 90→89); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Pattern_Matching 6→5, pending-total 89→88). Two typed graph edges (alternative_to → approximate-pattern-matching-mismatches; relates_to → test-unit-registry) — both source-supported. Graph lint reports the two edges' `source='edit-distance'` as "no source page" (the accepted concept-slug-as-source state, since this spec has no wiki/sources page); extract rebuilt 530 nodes / 4226 edges. No contradictions: the spec and the Hamming page agree — edit distance is the indel-tolerant complement, Hamming the substitution-only one.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/Validation/reports/PRIMER-STRUCT-001.md → [[primer-struct-001-report]]; added exact graph provenance for the thermodynamic-model contrast and [[primer-design]] dependency.
- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/Validation/reports/PROBE-DESIGN-001.md → [[probe-design-001-report]]; added exact graph provenance for TaqMan, specificity, and Tm relationships; split the validation-source index into A–M/N–Z shards under the 300-line cap.
- 2026-07-15 — ingest README.md → updated [[readme]] with the new top-level LLM Wiki section: authority/provenance contract, bounded retrieval flow, measured raw-docs-vs-wiki context snapshot, example natural-language/CLI queries, and maintenance commands; refreshed the project-source index entry.
- 2026-07-15 — hardened the LLM Wiki maintenance contract: root and sharded indexes now share the 300-line lint cap; provenance staleness accepts an atomic source+page refresh, requires a page refresh beside a staged source, and rejects later uncovered source changes; README word-volume figures now use the same whitespace counter on both sides. Added regression coverage for all rules and the Markdown/BM25 edge cases found during review. Updated [[readme]].
- 2026-07-15 — removed the redundant calendar-date snapshot label from README metrics; Git revision history is their version boundary. Updated [[readme]] to use the same versioned wording.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/Approximate_Matching_Hamming.md (Hamming approximate-matching SPEC — the PAT-APPROX-001 primary per-algorithm spec for `ApproximateMatcher.HammingDistance`/`FindWithMismatches` + `SequenceExtensions.HammingDistance`; case-insensitive substitutions-only k-mismatch search). CONTEXT per per-algorithm reconciliation brief: REUSED the existing Evidence-derived concept [[approximate-pattern-matching-mismatches]] (created 2026-07-10 from PAT-APPROX-003-Evidence), which already anchors the PAT-APPROX family and explicitly cites PAT-APPROX-001 as the `HammingDistance` primitive. No new page and NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Enriched with genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence-derived family page lacked: a "`HammingDistance` primitive and result-carrying `FindWithMismatches` surface (PAT-APPROX-001)" section — case-insensitivity (both operands uppercased; INV-02 holds under case-insensitive comparison), INV-01/INV-03 non-negativity+symmetry, `ArgumentNullException`/`ArgumentException`(unequal length) contract with O(n)/O(1), the `ApproximateMatchResult` shape (Position/MatchedSequence/Distance/MismatchPositions/MismatchType always Substitution) for the O(n·m) `FindWithMismatches`, threshold corner cases (maxMismatches<0→ArgumentOutOfRange, =0→exact, ≥len→all windows; null/empty/over-long→no matches), the null-`DnaSequence`→NullReferenceException gotcha, the ROSALIND HAMM d=7 oracle, and ApproximateMatcher.cs/SequenceExtensions.cs locations. Added the spec to sources: (now spec + Evidence), bumped source_commit→cf1c5ac6, updated→2026-07-15. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[approximate-pattern-matching-mismatches]] (covered 152→153, pending 91→90); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Pattern_Matching 7→6, pending-total 90→89). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged (concept already listed in the concepts shard). No new graph nodes/edges (implementation prose only; the concept's existing relates_to test-unit-registry / alternative_to k-mer-positions edges and body wikilinks unchanged) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions: spec and the recorded Evidence synthesis agree on the Hamming model, d=0-degenerates-to-exact, substitution-only scope, and worked oracles.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/Frequent_Words_With_Mismatches.md (PAT-APPROX-003 primary SPEC — Count_d/FindBestMatch/FindFrequentKmersWithMismatches, ROSALIND BA1H/BA1I/BA1N). RECONCILIATION: this spec is the same test unit as the existing Evidence-derived concept [[approximate-pattern-matching-mismatches]] (created 2026-07-10 from PAT-APPROX-003-Evidence), which already synthesizes BA1H/BA1I/BA1N, both counting semantics, the d-neighborhood, worked oracles, and the FindBestMatch tie-break. REUSED it — no new page, NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Enriched with genuinely-distinct spec content the concept lacked: FindFrequentKmersWithMismatches complexity O(n·k·|Σ|^d); a new "Scope boundaries" section covering the reverse-complement BA1J out-of-scope note (+ run-on-reverse-complement workaround), the non-ACGT alphabet nuance (matched literally by the Hamming scan but never enumerated as a neighbor substitution), and the recorded SuffixTree reuse-rejection decision (exact-index gives no Hamming-ball help). Added the spec to sources: (now spec + Evidence + Approximate_Matching_Hamming), bumped source_commit→8432fd38, updated→2026-07-15. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept (covered 155→156, pending 88→87); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Pattern_Matching 4→3, pending-total 87→86). No new page ⇒ index.md unchanged. No new graph nodes/edges (implementation/scope prose; existing relates_to test-unit-registry / alternative_to k-mer-positions edges unchanged) ⇒ graph lint/extract skipped. No contradictions: spec and the recorded synthesis agree on the Hamming model, d=0-degenerates-to-exact, all-ties return, substitution-only scope, and the BA1H/BA1I/BA1N oracles; the spec's own "Not implemented: reverse-complement (BA1J)" is now reflected verbatim in scope.
- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/IUPAC_Degenerate_Matching.md → NEW concept [[iupac-degenerate-matching]] (PAT-IUPAC-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `MotifFinder.FindDegenerateMotif(DnaSequence|string[, CancellationToken])` over `IupacHelper.MatchesIupac`; brute-force slide of an ambiguity-coded DNA motif over a subject, emitting every window whose bases all satisfy the allowed-base set of each of the 15 standard IUPAC codes, fixed Score=1.0, 0-based Position, O(n·m), cancellation every 1000 starts; guards for null seq / empty-or-overlong motif / lowercase-normalize / invalid-code rejection). DECISION: this is the *matching* direction and a genuinely distinct unit — the wiki already anticipated it as a separate unit in three places ([[known-motif-search]] "distinct from degenerate matching", [[iupac-degenerate-consensus]] "distinct from the matching direction", [[regulatory-element-detection]] "IUPAC ambiguity vocabulary applied to matching") — so a focused NEW concept was created rather than REUSE-enriching the generation-direction consensus page (which would conflate generation with matching). NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Inbound links wired from all three sibling concepts (each already had natural anchor text); those pages bumped source_commit→fcc46a43, updated→2026-07-15 (link-only touch, no sources change). Index: added the concept row to indexes/concepts.md, bumped index.md concept count 215→216. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[iupac-degenerate-matching]] (covered 156→157); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Pattern_Matching 3→2). Note: backlog.md's pending header was pre-existingly off-by-one vs the per-domain tables (said 87 while the tables summed to 86); corrected to 85 (86 real − 1 resolved). Graph: +1 concept node with 2 typed edges (relates_to concept:test-unit-registry via PAT-IUPAC-001; alternative_to concept:known-motif-search via the "extends exact pattern search by allowing ambiguity codes" framing). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions — the spec's IUPAC code table matches the NC-IUB 1984 vocabulary already tabulated in [[iupac-degenerate-consensus]]; the Kozak example here uses the degenerate `GCCGCCRCCATG` form vs the regulatory catalog's exact `GCCGCCACCATGG`, noted as two representations of the same signal (not a contradiction).

- 2026-07-15 — fixed literal-block extraction in the shared Markdown parser: list/blockquote markers inside open fences or raw HTML can no longer escape the block, and CommonMark processing-instruction, declaration, CDATA, block-tag, and custom-tag HTML forms are masked. Added business-rule regressions and made the 90% branch-coverage floor blocking in the pre-commit hook, CI sample, and README maintenance flow. Updated [[readme]] and provenance-reviewed all README-dependent pages; their domain content was unaffected by the tooling-only source change.
- 2026-07-15 — added a static, non-quantitative Euler map to README showing the conceptual overlap between biological meaning, algorithms/models, and evidence/limits, all enclosed by the wiki's navigation and provenance layer. Updated [[readme]]; no page taxonomy or dynamic metrics were introduced.
- 2026-07-15 — added a reproducible bilingual BM25 retrieval benchmark: 30 fixed intents, one gold concept per intent, its local `sources:` as the no-wiki gold set, paired English/Ukrainian questions, and a manually reviewed English normalization for each Ukrainian query. README reports Without→With LLM Wiki Hit@1/3/10: direct English 46.7/76.7/93.3% → 66.7/93.3/100%; direct Ukrainian 26.7/46.7/70.0% → 46.7/70.0/76.7%; normalized Ukrainian 53.3/76.7/96.7% → 70.0/96.7/100%. The table is explicitly retrieval, not generated-answer correctness. Updated [[readme]].
- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/Position_Weight_Matrix.md → NEW concept [[position-weight-matrix]] (PAT-PWM-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `MotifFinder.CreatePwm(IEnumerable<string>, double)` / `ScanWithPwm(DnaSequence, PositionWeightMatrix, double)` + the `PositionWeightMatrix` type; log-odds PWM/PSSM built from equal-length aligned DNA via PFM→PPM `(count+p)/(N+4p)` pseudocount smoothing (default p=0.25)→`log₂(PPM/0.25)` against a fixed uniform 0.25 background, fixed `double[4,L]` A/C/G/T layout; threshold scan emits each window scoring `>= threshold` as a MotifMatch with 0-based Position, summed log-odds Score, Pattern=Consensus; derived Consensus=per-column max base INV-02, MaxScore/MinScore=Σ column extrema INV-03, Length=training width INV-01). DECISION per per-algorithm brief: no existing Evidence-derived PWM concept and PWM is a genuinely distinct weighted-scoring motif branch (the wiki already anticipated it as a separate unit in [[known-motif-search]], [[iupac-degenerate-matching]], and [[consensus-from-alignment]]) — created a focused NEW concept rather than reuse-enriching a sibling. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Inbound links wired from all three sibling motif concepts (each already had natural plain-text "position-weight-matrix" anchor text, converted to wikilinks); those pages bumped source_commit→19070d6b, updated→2026-07-15 (link-only touch, no sources change). Index: added the concept row to indexes/concepts.md, bumped index.md concept count 216→217. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[position-weight-matrix]] (covered 157→158, pending 85→84); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Pattern_Matching 2→1, pending-total 85→84). Graph: +1 concept node with 2 typed edges (relates_to concept:test-unit-registry via PAT-PWM-001; alternative_to concept:consensus-from-alignment — spec §7.1 lists the single-best-base consensus as a related motif representation and the PWM's own Consensus field is that same per-column best-base collapse, but the PWM keeps the full weighted log-odds vector). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions — the spec's PFM/PPM/PWM construction, uniform-0.25 background, DNA-only simplification, and no-gap/no-p-value scope are synthesized verbatim; the two API-shape choices (Consensus used as MotifMatch.Pattern, inclusive `>=` threshold) are documented implementation decisions, not deviations from cited theory.

## [2026-07-15] ingest | docs/algorithms/Pattern_Matching/Suffix_Tree.md → NEW concept [[suffix-tree]]
   Primary per-algorithm SPEC (Ukkonen suffix tree data structure — `SuffixTree` / `SuffixTree.Persistent` / `SuffixTree.Core`). DECISION per the reconciliation brief: created a focused NEW concept rather than reuse-enriching [[exact-pattern-search]], because the spec is fundamentally the DATA STRUCTURE itself (Ukkonen online construction — active point / remainder / three extension rules / suffix links / −1 terminator; post-build bottom-up LeafCount + deepest-internal-node passes; dual in-memory-heap vs persistent-MMF-v6 backends behind one `ISuffixTree`; `struct`-constrained `ISuffixTreeNavigator<TNode>` JIT specialization; SHA-256 logical-hash + v2 serialization) — genuinely distinct from the narrow PAT-EXACT-001 exact-search-engine framing of [[exact-pattern-search]] (Contains/Count/FindAll primitives + DNA wrappers). The tree hosts the exact-search trio, LRS, LCS, and the MUMmer-style `FindExactMatchAnchors` MEM engine as separate query units. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Inbound links wired from [[exact-pattern-search]] and [[longest-repeated-substring]] (each already had natural "repository `SuffixTree`" anchor text, converted to [[suffix-tree]] wikilinks); both bumped source_commit→fdb24112, updated 2026-07-15 (link-only touch, no sources change). Index: added the concept row to indexes/concepts.md, bumped index.md concept count 217→218. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[suffix-tree]] (covered 158→159, pending 84→83); removed the now-empty Pattern_Matching section from [[backlog-pending]] (15→14 domains) and added a "Pattern_Matching domain fully covered" closure note consistent with the K-mer/Metagenomics/MolTools/Oncology/PanGenome closures — this ingest closes the Pattern_Matching domain (last pending doc). Graph: +1 concept node with 2 typed relates_to edges (→ concept:exact-pattern-search via §4.1–4.3 exact-search primitives; → concept:longest-repeated-substring via §2/§4.4 deepest-internal-node LRS). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No contradictions — the spec's Ukkonen construction, O(n) build / O(m) query complexity, LeafCount-precompute, and deepest-node LRS all agree with what the query-application concepts already synthesize; the only design choices are engineering (dual backends, navigator specialization, hybrid child storage, SIMD edges, v6 compact→large transition), not algorithm deviations.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Bootstrap_Analysis.md (PHYLO-BOOT-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]] (the reconciliation pattern: the unit's concept already existed from the PHYLO-BOOT-001 Evidence ingest). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized the FBP procedure, clade-identity rule, worked oracles, invariants, and the two documented assumptions. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct spec content the Evidence page lacked: the formal Contract (parameter defaults replicates=100/JukesCantor/UPGMA/seed=42, return type, distance/case-sensitivity handling, the later seed deviation), complexity O(B·(n·L+n³)) time / O(n²+n·L) space, and the method boundary — majority-rule consensus tree and TBE explicitly NOT implemented, the Felsenstein-vs-transfer exact-vs-gradual contrast, and the evaluated-but-unused suffix tree. Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→c9a7fd98, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[phylogenetic-bootstrap-support]] (covered 159→160, pending 83→82); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Phylogenetics 6→5). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two already declared. No contradictions: the spec and the Evidence agree on the procedure, invariants, and both documented assumptions.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Distance_Matrix.md (PHYLO-DIST-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[evolutionary-distance-matrix]] (the reconciliation pattern: the unit's concept already existed from the PHYLO-DIST-001 Evidence ingest). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized all four methods (Hamming/p-distance/JC69/K2P), the JC69/K2P formulas, symmetry/zero-diagonal/correction-ordering invariants, pairwise-deletion gap+ambiguity handling, saturation limits, the worked oracles, and the two documented assumptions. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct spec content the Evidence page lacked: the implementation entry point (`PhylogeneticAnalyzer.CalculatePairwiseDistance` / `CalculateDistanceMatrix` in Seqeron.Genomics.Phylogenetics/PhylogeneticAnalyzer.cs, JukesCantor enum default), the single-shared-column-scan structure with O(m) time / O(1) space per pair, and the refined K2P saturation (undefined when EITHER log argument `1−2S−V` or `1−2V` is non-positive, not just V≥1/2 — the impl guards both factors). Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→bbcb0ba3, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[evolutionary-distance-matrix]] (covered 160→161, pending 82→81); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Phylogenetics 5→4). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two already declared. No contradictions: the spec and the Evidence agree on the formulas, invariants, gap handling, and both documented assumptions.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Newick_Format.md (PHYLO-NEWICK-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `PhylogeneticAnalyzer.ToNewick(PhyloNode, bool)` / `ParseNewick(string)`, the phylogenetics family's Newick text I/O layer) → REUSE-reconciled into the family-hinge concept [[distance-based-tree-construction]]. DECISION: Newick is a **format serializer, not a separate algorithm** — the pre-existing Evidence source page [[phylo-newick-001-evidence]] and all three sibling PHYLO concepts ([[tree-statistics]], [[tree-comparison-metrics]], and the hinge itself) already frame it that way and explicitly say it "warrants no dedicated concept page." Honoring that prior curatorial decision plus the prefer-REUSE guidance, the spec was folded into the concept whose `PhyloNode` output the format round-trips, rather than minting a `newick-format` page. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report). Enriched the hinge concept with a new "Newick serialization I/O layer (PHYLO-NEWICK-001)" section covering the genuinely-distinct spec content: the Olsen-subset grammar, the ToNewick/ParseNewick contract (null node→"", empty/whitespace→ArgumentException, O(n)/O(h)), invariants INV-01..04 (semicolon terminator, InvariantCulture `.`-decimal F4 formatting, unquoted-label suppression of internal names, optional root branch length), the serializer/parser label asymmetry (internal names filtered to the unquoted subset & omitted vs leaf names verbatim vs permissive raw-run parsing + scientific notation), and the documented out-of-scope set (binary-only, no quoted labels, no `[]` comments, no underscore→blank; F4 ±0.00005). Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→f9b89f02, updated→2026-07-15. No new page → index counts unchanged. Backlog: added the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[distance-based-tree-construction]] (covered 161→162, pending 81→80); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Phylogenetics 4→3). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two the concept already declares. No contradictions: the spec's grammar, invariants, and scope limitations agree with the [[phylo-newick-001-evidence]] Evidence record (N1–N9) already ingested.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Tree_Comparison.md (PHYLO-COMP-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `RobinsonFouldsDistance` / `FindMRCA` / `PatristicDistance` in Seqeron.Genomics.Phylogenetics/PhylogeneticAnalyzer.cs) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (the reconciliation pattern: the unit's concept already existed from the PHYLO-COMP-001 Evidence ingest). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized all three routines (RF symmetric-difference of rooted clades, MRCA deepest-common-ancestor, patristic MRCA-path branch-length sum), the max-RF rooted-vs-unrooted formulas (2(n−2) vs 2(n−3)), the full invariant/oracle tables, the edge cases (null→null, missing taxon→null/NaN, zero-branch→0), and the two source-backed scope decisions (binary-only, rooted-only). Enriched with the genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence page lacked: the actual `O(n² log n)` time / `O(n²)` space cost of `RobinsonFouldsDistance` (it materializes+sorts subtree taxon lists into sorted-name clade keys via `GetClades`/`CollectClades` — NOT the Day-1985 linear bound); the MRCA `FindMRCA`→`FindMRCAInternal` structure with the public post-check that converts a leaf result for two distinct taxa to `null` (prevents a single found taxon masquerading as an ancestor), O(n)/O(h), returns `PhyloNode?`; the patristic `DistanceToTaxon` path accumulation with no non-negative-weight enforcement, `double`/`double.NaN` return, O(n)/O(h); and the test-pinned oracles (PD(A,B)=1.0, PD(A,C)=5.0, PD(C,D)=2.0; RF=2 three-taxa, RF=4 four-taxa). Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→7eb3b8b8, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[tree-comparison-metrics]] (covered 162→163, pending 80→79); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Phylogenetics 3→2). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two already declared. No contradictions: the spec and the Evidence agree on the metrics, invariants, edge cases, and both scope decisions.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Tree_Construction.md (PHYLO-TREE-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `PhylogeneticAnalyzer.BuildTree` / `BuildTreeFromMatrix` UPGMA & Neighbor-Joining) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[distance-based-tree-construction]] (the reconciliation pattern: the family-hinge concept already existed from the PHYLO-TREE-001 Evidence ingest — this IS that unit's primary spec). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized both methods (UPGMA rooted/ultrametric weighted-average clustering with height=d/2; NJ Q-matrix selection, the three branch-length/distance-update formulas, negative-branch preservation, midpoint-rooting final join), the shared+method-specific invariant tables, the worked 5S-rRNA / 5-taxon oracles, and the edge-case table. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct spec content the Evidence page lacked: the full `BuildTree(sequences, distanceMethod, treeMethod)` signature with `distanceMethod` defaulting to `JukesCantor` (passed to `CalculateDistanceMatrix`) and `treeMethod` to `UPGMA`, the §3.3 ArgumentException validation contract, O(n²) **space** for both builders (was only time-annotated), the UPGMA cluster-index working-distance dictionary + `Math.Max(0, …)` non-negative clamp, and the §5.4 accepted deviation (NJ returned as a rooted `PhyloNode`) reconciled against the "no deviations" Evidence line plus the §6.2 builder limitations (no bootstrap values / multifurcations / advanced tree search). Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→0180b9c3, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[distance-based-tree-construction]] (covered 163→164, pending 79→78); removed from [[backlog-pending]] (Phylogenetics 2→1). Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two the concept already declares (relates_to test-unit-registry, depends_on evolutionary-distance-matrix). No contradictions: the spec and the Evidence agree on both methods, invariants, formulas, and edge cases; the single §5.4 rooted-NJ deviation is reconciled in the concept's implementation-notes section.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Phylogenetics/Tree_Statistics.md (PHYLO-STATS-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `PhylogeneticAnalyzer.GetLeaves` / `CalculateTreeLength` / `GetTreeDepth`) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[tree-statistics]] (the reconciliation pattern: the unit's concept already existed from the PHYLO-STATS-001 Evidence ingest). This ingest CLOSES the Phylogenetics domain (last pending doc). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized all three summaries (leaf set / terminal nodes, total tree length = Σ branch lengths, tree height/depth = edges on the longest root→leaf path), the leaf/height/depth definitions traced to Wikipedia + Biopython + DendroPy + Rzhetsky-Nei, the full conventions/invariants oracle table (balanced-4-taxon 4/6/2, caterpillar 4/5/3, single leaf 1/len/0, null ∅/0/−1), the single-node height-0 and empty-tree height-−1 conventions, and the one empty-tree↔null assumption. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence page lacked: a new "Implementation (`PhylogeneticAnalyzer`)" section covering the three static-method entry points, the O(n)-time/O(h)-space traversal cost, the three recurrences (length = root.BranchLength + length(Left)+length(Right); depth = 1+max(depth(Left),depth(Right))), the `yield` pre-order recursion producing left-to-right leaf order, the named `EmptyTreeHeight` (−1) constant, the strict binary-tree model (no multifurcations, no exceptions on shape), the suffix-tree-not-applicable note, and the topological-vs-Biopython-`depths()` (branch-length) distinction with the pointer to `PatristicDistance`/`CalculateTreeLength`. Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→603506c0, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged. Backlog: moved the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[tree-statistics]] (covered 164→165, pending 78→77 across 14→13 domains); removed the now-empty Phylogenetics section from [[backlog-pending]] and added the domain-closure note. Hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new typed graph edges — the spec supports no relationship beyond the two already declared. No contradictions: the spec and the Evidence agree on the three measures, invariants, edge cases, and the empty-tree↔null assumption.

- 2026-07-15 — ingest docs/algorithms/Population_Genetics/Allele_Frequency.md (POP-FREQ-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — `PopulationGeneticsAnalyzer.CalculateAlleleFrequencies` / `CalculateMAF` / `FilterByMAF` in Seqeron.Genomics.Population/PopulationGeneticsAnalyzer.cs) → RECONCILED into the existing Evidence-derived concept [[allele-genotype-frequencies]] (the reconciliation pattern: the family-foundational concept already existed from the POP-FREQ-001 Evidence ingest — this IS that unit's primary spec). Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized biallelic diploid allele-frequency from genotype counts (p=(2·n_AA+n_AB)/2N, q symmetric, p+q=1), MAF from a 0/1/2 dosage genotype vector (alt_freq=Σg/2N, MAF=min(f,1−f), 0≤MAF≤0.5, monomorphic→0, 50/50→0.5), MAF filtering, the four-o'clock worked oracle (0.70/0.30), the invariant/edge-case tables (zero samples→(0,0), empty vector→0, negative counts→ArgumentOutOfRangeException), and the scope boundaries (no HWE, no multiallelic, no phasing/imputation — deferring to sibling units). Enriched with the genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence page lacked: `FilterByMAF` uses an inclusive band `[minMAF, maxMAF]` defaulting to `[0.01, 0.5]`, reads a STORED `Variant.AlleleFrequency` field (MAF=min(f,1−f)) rather than re-counting genotypes, and `yield return`s matches lazily so input order is preserved. Added the spec path to `sources:` and bumped source_commit→55ee9455, updated→2026-07-15. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence report); no new page created so index counts unchanged.

Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized the binomial admixture model (Eq. 2 log-likelihood, g_ij∈{0,1,2}, Q/F matrices), the FRAPPE EM update (Eq. 4 with a/b posteriors), the Eq. 5 ε=10⁻⁴ convergence rule, F-fixed supervised semantics, the simplex/monotone-ascent/uninformative-fixed-point invariants, the symmetric-two-population + single-SNP + identical-panel worked oracles, missing/length-mismatch edge cases, and the K!-permutation identifiability discussion. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence page lacked: a new "Implementation (Seqeron)" section covering the three static entry points, the `AncestryProportion { IndividualId, Proportions }` output (dict summing to 1), the §3.1 input contract, `maxIterations` default 100 layered over the ε early stop with the named `AncestryLogLikelihoodTolerance` constant, total (non-throwing) validation, and the divide-by-2J renormalization / suffix-tree-N/A note; a CORRECTED complexity paragraph distinguishing the joint-(Q+F) O(IJK²) from the F-fixed per-individual O(iterations·J·K) / full-call O(I·iterations·J·K) with O(K) space (the concept previously stated only O(IJK²)); and the all-SNPs-missing → uniform-prior edge case.

Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized Wright's (1965) variance-based Fst = σ_S²/(pBar(1−pBar)) with size-weighted pBar and σ_S², the ratio-of-sums multi-locus aggregation, the heterozygosity-based partition (Fis=1−Hi/Hs, Fit=1−Hi/Ht, Fst=1−Hs/Ht) with the exact (1−Fit)=(1−Fis)(1−Fst) identity, the 0≤Fst≤1 / −1…1 Fis,Fit ranges, the pairwise-matrix diagonal-0/symmetry invariants, the not-a-metric (no triangle inequality) note, the identical→0 / fixed-opposite p1=1,p2=0→1 / denominator-zero→0 / empty→0 edge cases, the size-weighting-not-Weir–Cockerham choice, and the qualitative differentiation bands + Cavalli-Sforza/Elhaik reference oracles. Enriched with the genuinely-distinct implementation content the Evidence page lacked: the §5.4 accepted-deviation that locus alignment is POSITIONAL — `CalculateFst` iterates only the shared prefix `Math.Min(pop1.Count, pop2.Count)`, silently dropping extra loci and comparing MISALIGNED loci without error (inherited by CalculatePairwiseFst); and a new "Implementation shape and cost" section covering the three static entry points + the `FStatistics(Fst,Fis,Fit,Population1,Population2)` record (labels copied verbatim from pop1Name/pop2Name), the per-method complexity (scalar O(L)/O(1); pairwise O(k²·L)/O(k²) with upper-triangle-computed-then-mirrored and diagonal left at default 0; F-statistics O(L) single pass), the distinct `variantData` tuple shape (HetObs1,N1,HetObs2,N2,AlleleFreq1,AlleleFreq2) vs the (AlleleFreq,SampleSize) tuples CalculateFst consumes, and the no-explicit-range-validation note.

Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized the Hardy-Weinberg principle (f=p²/2pq/q², Hardy 1908 / Weinberg 1908), the biallelic chi-square goodness-of-fit test (allele-freq estimation p=(2n_AA+n_Aa)/2n, expected counts, Pearson χ²=Σ(O−E)²/E, df=1, lower-incomplete-gamma p-value, α=0.05 critical value 3.841), the critical-value table, the Ford scarlet-tiger-moth (1469/138/5, χ²≈0.83) + perfect-HWE + excess-heterozygote worked oracles, the n=0 / monomorphic / expected-0-term-skipped edge cases, the deviation-cause list (inbreeding, selection, mutation, migration, drift, genotyping error), and the scope (no Wigginton 2005 exact test, no multiallelic).

Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized the `Q=−10·log₁₀(p)` definition + inverse + the Q/error-rate/accuracy table, Q20/Q30 thresholds and the Q93 cap, the two live offsets (33 → Q0–93 ASCII 33–126; 64 → Q0–62 ASCII 64–126) with the Solexa contrast, the boundary characters (`!`/`I`/`~` and `@`/`h`/`~`), the range-based auto-detection with the ambiguous `@`–`I` window defaulting to Phred+33, and the score-preserving ±31 re-offset with both representability rules (Phred+64→33 always safe; Phred+33→64 overflow for Q>62 → `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, worked `@h~`→`!I_` and `!I`→`@h`) plus the silent-corruption "why the distinction bites" motivation.

Assessed the docs/algorithms/ navigation README: it is purely a navigational index (domain-grouped section headers linking to the per-algorithm folders, every one of which is already synthesized by a concept in the [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept table) plus a Canonicalization section (alias-ID table + legacy-folder consolidation status) whose content is already owned by the [[canonical-algorithm-map]] source page. No genuinely wiki-worthy synthesis not already captured, so per SCHEMA coverage-exclude reasoning it warrants NO concept and NO source page — creating one would just duplicate the concept table and the canonical map. Upgraded the provisional [[backlog]] Note ("README.md remains index-only; ingest if a navigational need arises") to a definitive resolution: recorded as a coverage exclusion (index-only, no dedicated page) with rationale. Not present in [[backlog-pending]] and never a Pending row, so no pending removal and no coverage-count change. No index.md / graph / sources changes; no files touched outside wiki/.

Reconciliation: verified no existing concept covers this unit — the [[repetitive-element-detection]] anchor synthesizes only the head-to-tail *tandem*, reverse-complement *inverted*, and RepeatMasker-class sub-problems, and [[longest-repeated-substring]] (GENOMIC-REPEAT-001, GenomicAnalyzer) enumerates *any* recurring substring as a position list; direct-repeat detection is the genuinely-distinct same-orientation **dispersed-pair** operation (two identical 5'→3' copies separated by a configurable spacer, reported as pairs). Created the page with the core model `S[i..i+L)=S[j..j+L)` ∧ `j>i+L−1+minSpacing`, `Spacing=j−i−L`; the two-overload contract (minLength=5/maxLength=50/minSpacing=1 defaults, 0-based positions, DnaSequence-throws vs raw-string-uppercase-and-empty semantics); the suffix-tree build + `FindAllOccurrences` per-candidate-length algorithm with hash-set `(First,Second,Length)` dedup; O(n) build + O(r·n·(m+k)) detection complexity; INV-01..04 oracles; the exact-only / no-biological-annotation Simplified scope; and the REP-DIRECT-001 fuzzing fix (raw-string overload now mirrors the `minLength<2`/`maxLength<minLength` guards, closing a `minLength=0` zero-length-candidate `O(n²)` blow-up reachable via the `find_direct_repeats` MCP tool).

Reconciliation: verified no existing concept covers this unit — the [[repetitive-element-detection]] anchor's inverted-repeat section synthesizes only the annotation `RepeatAnalyzer` IUPACpal `W·G·W̄ᴿ` model (ANNOT-REPEAT-001, imperfect up to k mismatches) and the RNA `RnaSecondaryStructure` stem model (RNA-INVERT-001); `RepeatFinder.FindInvertedRepeats` is a genuinely-distinct *third* implementation (DNA-only, **exact** left/right-arm reverse-complement, explicit `CanFormHairpin` flag), the direct sibling of [[direct-repeat-detection]] (REP-DIRECT-001) from the same `RepeatFinder` class. Created the page with the core model `R=ReverseComplement(L)`, `TotalLength=2·ArmLength+LoopLength`, `LoopLength=RightArmStart−(LeftArmStart+ArmLength)`; the two-overload contract (minArmLength=4/maxLoopLength=50/minLoopLength=3 defaults, 0-based coords, `InvertedRepeatResult` fields, DnaSequence-throws vs raw-string-uppercase-and-empty); the brute-force left-arm-start × arm-length scan with `DnaSequence.GetReverseComplementString()`, hash-set `(LeftArmStart,RightArmStart,ArmLength)` dedup, and O(n·A²·L)/O(k+A) complexity (no suffix tree, unlike the direct-repeat sibling); INV-01..05 oracles incl. `CanFormHairpin=LoopLength≥3` and **palindrome = zero-loop** special case (not returned under default minLoopLength=3); the exact-only vs EMBOSS `einverted` DP comparison as the Simplified scope; and the REP-INV-001 fuzzing fix (raw-string overload now mirrors the `minArmLength<2`/`minLoopLength<0` guards, closing a `minArmLength=0` zero-length-arm nonsense path). Inbound links added from the family anchor [[repetitive-element-detection]] (third-implementation pointer) and from the sibling [[direct-repeat-detection]] (the "inverted repeat" mention now links here); page also links [[test-unit-registry]], [[algorithm-validation-evidence]], [[research-grade-limitations]]. sources = the spec; source_commit 8767a4ac (also bumped on the two touched sibling pages).

Verified coverage: the anchor already synthesizes the REP-STR-001 **Evidence** — the Benson (1999) Tandem Repeats Finder approximate/imperfect model (period, copy number, majority-rule consensus, percent matches/indels, match `+2`/mismatch·indel `−7` weights, `Minscore=50`), the `ComputeBernoulliStatistics` PM/PI adjacent-copy layer with `E[heads]=PM·d` and the un-implemented k-tuple seeding residual, the CAGCAGCAGTAGCAGCAG worked oracle, the 1–6 bp microsatellite class + primitive-unit rule, and the exact-vs-approximate distinction. Enriched only with the spec's genuinely-distinct implementation surface for the **perfect default** detector (which the concept had not described — it jumped straight to the approximate path) in a new "Perfect STR detection (`RepeatFinder.FindMicrosatellites`)" subsection: the four overloads (DnaSequence/raw-string × cancellable `(CancellationToken, IProgress<double>)` with `0.0→1.0` progress), the null-throws vs uppercase-and-empty input semantics, the `minUnitLength`/`maxUnitLength`/`minRepeats` = 1/6/3 defaults and `<1`/`<minUnitLength`/`<2` validation floors, the `MicrosatelliteResult` (Position 0-based, RepeatUnit, RepeatCount, TotalLength = unit×count, RepeatType via `ClassifyRepeatType`) mono–hexa output, the `IsRedundantUnit` primitive-unit motif filter and the contained-interval suppression that is deliberately **narrower than a blanket non-overlap rule** (spec §5.4 Deviation 1 — partially-overlapping non-containing repeats both reported), the `SequenceAligner.GlobalAlign` reuse by the approximate path, and the `O(n·U·R)` perfect / `O(n²·P·L²)` approximate worst-case cost.

Reconciliation (RECONCILIATION PATTERN — palindrome vs inverted-repeat/restriction): verified the biological DNA palindrome (`S = ReverseComplement(S)`, even-length, `A↔T`/`G↔C`) is genuinely distinct at the *implementation* level — it has its own dedicated entry point `RepeatFinder.FindPalindromes` (validating, returns `PalindromeResult`) plus a lighter `GenomicAnalyzer.FindPalindromes` (returns `PalindromeInfo`, no explicit validation), its own test unit REP-PALIN-001, and an even-length step-by-2 scan — NOT folded into the loop-bearing `RepeatFinder.FindInvertedRepeats` ([[inverted-repeat-detection]], REP-INV-001), which will not report the zero-loop palindrome under its default `minLoopLength=3`, nor into the IUPACpal/RNA IR or class-assignment models of the [[repetitive-element-detection]] anchor. Conceptually the palindrome is the zero-loop special case of an inverted repeat, but the separate method + return types + unit make it its own page (same NEW-concept pattern as the sibling [[direct-repeat-detection]]/[[inverted-repeat-detection]] specs). Created the page with the core model `Palindrome(S) ⇔ S = ReverseComplement(S)` and the basewise even-length condition; the two-entry-point contract table (RepeatFinder DnaSequence/string validating — throws ArgumentNullException/ArgumentOutOfRangeException on null, `minLength<4`, odd `minLength`, `maxLength<minLength`; raw-string uppercases + empty-yields-nothing; GenomicAnalyzer same scan, no checks; `minLength`=4 even ≥4 / `maxLength`=12 defaults; `Position`(0-based)/`Sequence`/`Length` output); the even-length step-by-2 brute-force scan with per-window reverse-complement equality and all-overlapping-windows-reported semantics, `O(n·r·m)` / `O(m)` (no suffix tree); INV-01..04 oracles (Sequence=RC(Sequence), even lengths, in-bounds, Length correctness) + the EcoRI/BamHI/HindIII/TaqI/AluI/NotI/SmaI/EcoRV reference-site table; the exact-only / no-IUPAC-degeneracy / no-enzyme-catalog Simplified scope (→ `RestrictionAnalyzer`/[[restriction-site-detection]]); and the one accepted deviation (GenomicAnalyzer omits RepeatFinder's explicit validation → divergent failure surface, equivalent core).

Reconciliation (RECONCILIATION PATTERN — tandem vs repetitive-element/microsatellite; sibling Genomic_Analysis/Tandem_Repeat_Detection.md already covered-via-concept as GENOMIC-TANDEM-001): verified the anchor already synthesizes `GenomicAnalyzer.FindTandemRepeats` — as the consolidated GENOMIC-TANDEM-001 duplicate of REP-TANDEM-001 — including its exact head-to-tail model (period = unit length, copy number ≥ 2), its period-ambiguous non-canonicalizing behaviour (a run reported once per unit-length interpretation), and the 1–6 bp microsatellite class; the spec introduces no new *detector*, so no contradiction. Enriched only with the spec's genuinely-distinct implementation surface — the `RepeatFinder.GetTandemRepeatSummary(DnaSequence, int minRepeats=3)` **aggregation** helper (which the concept had not described) in a new "Aggregation view" paragraph in §1: it validates `sequence` (ArgumentNullException on null) and delegates straight to `FindMicrosatellites(sequence, 1, 6, minRepeats)` (inheriting its `minRepeats ≥ 2` floor), returning a single `TandemRepeatSummary` record — total repeat count, total repeat bases, percent coverage, longest repeat, most-frequent repeat unit, plus dedicated per-class counts — with an empty sequence → zero totals / 0% coverage, and the **two scope caveats** that fall out of the delegation: (a) the summary sees only 1–6 bp units so minisatellite/macrosatellite tandems that `FindTandemRepeats` can detect are excluded, and (b) its named per-class count fields stop at **tetranucleotide** (penta/hexa feed totals + bases but get no dedicated field); it therefore inherits `IsRedundantUnit` primitive-unit filtering + contained-interval suppression from `FindMicrosatellites`, not the period-ambiguous behaviour of `FindTandemRepeats`.

Verified coverage — the concept already synthesized the four independent bracket families `()`/`[]`/`{}`/`<>` + uppercase/lowercase letter-pair pseudoknot systems, the crossing-helix `([)]` / `<<<<[[[[....>>>>]]]]` / `((((AAAA....))))aaaa` equivalences, the per-family one-stack-each parse with `i<j` pairs, the per-family balance validation (`(]` malformed, crossing families valid), the single-stranded non-bracket WUSS symbols (`-`,`,`,`:`,`.`) all ignored, the worked parse/validate oracle tables, the INV per-family invariants, and the two API-contract assumptions (best-effort malformed parse silently dropping stray closers; empty/null = valid pair-free).

Enriched only the spec's genuinely-distinct implementation surface: the shared precomputed `byte[128*128]` `PairLookup` (branch-free O(1), ~16 KB, seeded symmetrically so INV-01/02/03 hold by construction), the 0–127 ASCII bounds-check that yields the "junk input → false/null, no exception" behaviour, the RnaStructure-surface divergence that a DNA `T` in `CanPair`/`GetBasePairType` does NOT pair (only `GetComplement` treats T→U→A) vs the MiRnaAnalyzer T→U normalisation, `GetComplement`'s delegation to Core `SequenceExtensions.GetRnaComplementBase`, and the "Not implemented" non-canonical pairs (Hoogsteen, sheared G•A, inosine I•U/I•A/I•C).

DECISION (per the reconciliation brief, judged from the spec): this is a genuinely-distinct engine, NOT an implementation surface on the simplified [[rna-partition-function-mccaskill]] (RNA-PARTITION-001) — the spec's §2.5 contrasts full **Turner-2004 NN** energy vs the simplified fixed-per-pair `E_bp` teaching model, and the simplified page itself listed a "full Turner-parameter partition function" as **not implemented**. This unit is that missing engine: it reuses the MFE folder's Turner-2004 loop energies under Boltzmann-weighted inside recurrences `Vexp`/`WMexp`/`Wexp` (mirror of `FillDp` under `min→Σ`, `+ΔG→×exp(−ΔG/RT)`; `Z = Wexp(0,n−1)`, `RT = 0.61626805` @ 310.15 K), exposes distinct entry points and distinct outputs (per-base `p_unpaired(i)=1−Σ_jP(i,j)`, ensemble `ΔG=−RT·ln Z`, RNAplfold-style region accessibility), computes both marginals by **constrained re-folds** (`Z_forbid(i)/Z`, `Z_require(i,j)/Z` — no bespoke outside recursion, so `Σ_jP+p_unpaired=1` to ~1e-15) at `O(n⁵)` bpp / `O(n³)` for Z/p_unpaired/accessibility / `O(n²)` space, and drives the **TargetScan context++ SA** feature (14-nt window ending 7 nt 3′ of the seed-match start, log10 + min-max Agarwal-2015 scaling, single `W=80`/`L=40` local fold, off-UTR → SA=0 in `OmittedFeatures`) consumed by [[mirna-target-site-prediction]]. Created the page with the comparison-with-simplified table, the Boltzmann NN recurrences, the constrained-refold implementation, the `UnpairedProbabilityResult` contract, INV-01..06 (Z≥1, P∈[0,1], Σ_jP≤1, p_unpaired∈[0,1], ΔG_ens≤MFE, Z_open/Z∈[0,1]), the `GAAAC` worked oracle (Z=1.0001565…, P(0,4)=1.5648e-4, ΔG_ens≈−9.644e-5), edge cases, and the pseudoknot-free / NN-model / temperature-specific / O(n⁵) / single-W=80 limitations. Cross-linked the simplified sibling [[rna-partition-function-mccaskill]] to it (its "not implemented" note now points here) and bumped that page's source_commit→18007bb7, updated 2026-07-17 (link-only touch, no sources change).

NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report); hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No typed graph edges emitted — per-algorithm SPEC with no Evidence-style registry slug, so only body-wikilink mention edges apply. No contradictions: the spec's Turner-NN Boltzmann recurrence, McCaskill formalism, invariants, and complexity agree with the simplified sibling and the MFE/energy family concepts; the only design choices are the constrained-refold marginals (exactness over speed for short SA windows) and the single-W=80 local fold (documented deviation from RNAplfold's full sliding-window average).

DECISION (per the reconciliation brief): the GC-skew surface was previously split across three sibling pages by tier — the scalar formula/range on [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] (which explicitly flagged the standalone `gc-skew` unit as "separately flagged, not yet ingested"), the windowed profile + population variance on [[windowed-gc-profile-and-variance]] (SEQ-GC-ANALYSIS-001), and the cumulative diagram + argmin/argmax origin locator on [[replication-origin-cumulative-skew]] (SEQ-REPLICATION-001) — but NO page was the `GcSkewCalculator` class-level anchor for the standalone SEQ-GCSKEW-001 unit. Created the focused NEW concept as that anchor rather than force-fitting it onto a tier page, keeping GC skew DISTINCT from the origin-prediction consumer as the brief required. Genuinely-distinct content the siblings lacked: the whole-sequence scalar `CalculateGcSkew` entry point + INV-01 bound [−1,1] / INV-02 zero-denominator⇒0 / INV-03 window-center = WindowStart+WindowSize/2; the four-entry-point map with the cumulative routine's non-overlapping (stepSize=windowSize) behaviour; and the headline **parameter-validation sharp edge** — only the typed DnaSequence windowed/cumulative overloads throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException for windowSize<1/stepSize<1, while the raw-string overloads and the higher-level PredictReplicationOrigin/AnalyzeGcContent helpers bypass validation, so nonpositive sizes are unsupported and stepSize=0 (string windowed) / windowSize=0 (string cumulative) can produce non-terminating enumerations. Cross-linked back from [[nucleotide-composition-skew]] (the "not yet ingested" note now points to [[gc-skew]]; updated 2026-07-17, link-only touch). sources = the spec; source_commit 0a33b97b.

Backlog: added the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[gc-skew]] (status line covered 194→195, pending 38→37 across 7 domains); removed the row from the [[backlog-pending]] Sequence_Composition table (8→7 rows, header 35→34 docs) and the mirrored [[backlog]] pending count. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report); hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). Graph: recompiled via wiki_graph_extract — +1 concept node with 4 typed edges (relates_to test-unit-registry, specializes nucleotide-composition-skew, relates_to windowed-gc-profile-and-variance, relates_to replication-origin-cumulative-skew). No contradictions: the spec's skew formula, O(n) scalar / streaming windowed complexity, zero-denominator convention, and window-center reporting all agree with what the three sibling tier pages already synthesize; the Simplified status and the cross-overload validation asymmetry refine (do not contradict) them.

- 2026-07-17 — ingest docs/algorithms/Sequence_Composition/Linguistic_Complexity.md (SEQ-COMPLEX-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — the scalar `SequenceComplexity.CalculateLinguisticComplexity(DnaSequence|string, int maxWordLength = 10)` in Seqeron.Genomics.Analysis/SequenceComplexity.cs: the **summation-variant linguistic complexity** `LC = Σᵢ Vᵢ / Σᵢ Vmax,i` over word lengths `1..m` (`m = min(maxWordLength, N)`), `Vᵢ` = distinct length-`i` subwords via `HashSet<string>`, `Vmax,i = min(4^i, N−i+1)`, status *Simplified*) → NEW CONCEPT [[linguistic-complexity]]. DECISION (per the reconciliation brief, judged from the spec): this is a genuinely-distinct **scalar** measure of the `SEQ-COMPLEX-*` complexity family, NOT a reconcile onto [[sequence-complexity-compression-lempel-ziv]] (LZ76 variable-length phrases) / [[dust-low-complexity-score]] (fixed-k=3 triplet, high⇒low) / [[k-mer-statistics]] k-entropy (frequency-based) — LC is a *vocabulary-usage ratio* (presence/absence of distinct fixed-length subwords over the combinatorial max). It was previously surfaced only **per-window** inside [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] (SEQ-COMPLEX-WINDOW-001), whose prose/evidence explicitly flagged the standalone unit "SEQ-COMPLEX-001 … not yet separately ingested"; created this page as the whole-sequence scalar anchor (same shared `CalculateLinguisticComplexityCore`). Distinct content: the two-overload contract (typed throws on null/`maxWordLength<1`; string returns 0 for null/empty, uppercases, **no alphabet validation**), INV-01 `0≤LC≤1` (DNA K=4) / INV-02 empty⇒0 / INV-03 length cap, DNA-oriented denominator caveat (raw-string non-ACGT can exceed [0,1]), `O(n·k²)` direct hash enumeration (Troyanskaya 2002 suffix-tree deliberately NOT implemented), and oracles `ACGTACGT`→23/29≈0.7931 / poly-A→6/29≈0.2069 / `ATGCATGC`≈0.83968. sources = the spec; source_commit e961cd9f. MCP: **re-homed** the scalar pair `complexity_linguistic` / `linguistic_complexity` off [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] (they wrap `CalculateLinguisticComplexity`, not the windowed driver) onto [[linguistic-complexity]] in [[mcp-tool-catalog]] (mapped 212 unchanged, distinct concepts 122→123); the windowed profile keeps only `windowed_complexity`. Cross-links: updated [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]] prose ("not yet separately ingested" → [[linguistic-complexity]]) and added the spec to its `sources:` + bumped its source_commit→e961cd9f / updated 2026-07-17; repointed the SEQ-COMPLEX-001 verdict row in [[validation-verdicts]] (was [[windowed-sequence-complexity-profile]]) and the `Complexity`-field pointer in [[seq-summary-001-evidence]] + the standalone-unit note in [[seq-complex-window-001-evidence]] to [[linguistic-complexity]]. Index: concepts shard +1 entry (scalar vocabulary-usage member, placed after the windowed profile in the complexity family), root index.md concept count 223→224. Backlog: added the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[linguistic-complexity]] (status covered 195→196, pending 37→36 across 7 domains); removed the row from the [[backlog-pending]] Sequence_Composition table (7→6 rows, header 34→33 docs) and the mirrored [[backlog]] pending count. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report); hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). Graph: frontmatter carries 2 typed relationships (relates_to test-unit-registry; part_of windowed-sequence-complexity-profile). No contradictions: the spec's summation LC, `min(4^i, N−i+1)` bound, invariants, and complexity agree with what the windowed page already synthesized per-window; the only refinements are the standalone scalar entry point, the two-overload validation asymmetry, and the DNA-denominator caveat.

- 2026-07-17 — ingest docs/algorithms/Sequence_Composition/RNA_Complement.md (SEQ-RNACOMP-001 primary per-algorithm SPEC — the per-base, IUPAC-complete RNA complement `SequenceExtensions.GetRnaComplementBase(char)` in Seqeron.Genomics.Core/SequenceExtensions.cs: an `[AggressiveInlining]` O(1) `switch` expression mapping the RNA alphabet A↔U, C↔G plus all eleven degenerate IUPAC codes per Biopython `ambiguous_rna_complement` (T treated as U ⇒ T→A; recognized symbols uppercased; non-IUPAC chars pass through unchanged incl. case), status Production) → REUSE existing concept [[rna-base-pairing]]. DECISION (per the reconciliation brief): RNA complement is NOT a genuinely-distinct unit — the RNA-base-pairing concept already carries a dedicated "SEQ-family full-IUPAC RNA complement (SEQ-RNACOMP-001)" section (ingested earlier from the Evidence doc) documenting the same `GetRnaComplementBase` chemistry, the reciprocal/self-complementary/pass-through code classes, the uppercase-vs-Biopython casing divergence, the involution invariant, and the DNA-path contrast (`GetRnaComplementBase('A')='U'` vs `GetComplementBase('A')='T'`); the spec adds no new algorithm, only method-level detail. Reconciled onto that page rather than creating a redundant `rna-complement` page. Distinct spec-only content enriched into the existing section: the fully-qualified entry-point signature + implementation location (SequenceExtensions.cs), the O(1) time/space `switch`-expression complexity (no lookup table, suffix tree N/A), CORRECTED the self-complementary set to W/S/N and moved `X` to the pass-through class (per spec §4.2 INV-04 + worked example, where the prior Evidence-derived prose wrongly listed X→X self-complementary), the explicit "returned unchanged including original case / never an exception for any char" invalid-base contract, and the Biopython `"ACGTUacgtuXYZxyz"` → repo `"UGCAAUGCAAXRZxRz"` worked oracle. Added the spec path to the page's `sources:` and bumped `source_commit` 6b38ddee→19b199ec / updated 2026-07-16→2026-07-17. Backlog: added the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[rna-base-pairing]] (status covered 196→197, pending 36→35 across 7 domains); removed the row from the [[backlog-pending]] Sequence_Composition table (6→5 rows, header 33→32 docs) and the mirrored [[backlog]] pending count. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report); hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new concept page ⇒ no index shard entry, root concept count unchanged (224). No contradictions: the spec's complement table, T→U convention, uppercase casing, pass-through behaviour, involution and O(1) complexity all agree with what the RNA-base-pairing SEQ-RNACOMP-001 section already synthesized; the only refinements are the entry-point/complexity detail, the X-handling correction, and the worked oracle.

DECISION (per the reconciliation brief): replication-origin prediction is NOT a genuinely-distinct unit — the cumulative-GC-skew concept (SEQ-REPLICATION-001, ingested earlier from the Evidence doc) is already its canonical home, covering the integer cumulative skew, the argmin=origin/argmax=terminus locating rule, the `53 97` Rosalind BA1F re-derivation, the tie-break, and the threshold-free `IsSignificant` (max>min); the spec adds no new algorithm, only method-level surface detail. Reconciled onto that page as the canonical PRIMARY spec rather than creating a redundant `replication-origin-prediction` page. Distinct spec-only content enriched (new "Implementation contract" section): the two `PredictReplicationOrigin` entry-point signatures + location (GcSkewCalculator.cs), the `ReplicationOriginPrediction` record-struct output-field table, the no-window/no-threshold note, INV-01…06 (first-index tie-break via strict `<`/`>`, `OriginSkew ≤ 0 ≤ TerminusSkew` from `Skew_0=0`, `[0,n]` prefix bounds, A/T inert), the single-pass O(n)/O(1) complexity + suffix-tree-N/A rationale, and the edge-case contract (no-G/C & null/empty-string → zero prediction / not significant; single `G` → origin 0, terminus 1; null `DnaSequence` → `ArgumentNullException`; single-position return vs BA1F all-minimizers). Added the spec path to the page's `sources:` and bumped `source_commit` c094b65e→52fb6065 / updated 2026-07-10→2026-07-17. Backlog: added the row to [[backlog]] Covered-via-concept → [[replication-origin-cumulative-skew]] (status covered 197→198, pending 35→34 across 7 domains); removed the row from the [[backlog-pending]] Sequence_Composition table (5→4 rows, header 32→31 docs) and the mirrored [[backlog]] pending count. NO wiki/sources/ page (spec ≠ Evidence/Validation report); hub [[algorithm-validation-evidence]] unchanged (spec docs are not added to the hub). No new concept page ⇒ no index shard entry, root concept count unchanged (224). No contradictions: the spec's cumulative-skew convention, argmin/argmax locating rule, tie-break, `IsSignificant` predicate, and O(n)/O(1) complexity all agree with what the SEQ-REPLICATION-001 concept already synthesized; the only refinements are the entry-point signatures, the record-struct output contract, and the overload/edge-case detail.

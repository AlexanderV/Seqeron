# Suffix-tree controlled refactoring

A disciplined, multi-cycle refactoring campaign on the Ukkonen [[suffix-tree]] engine
(`SuffixTree`, `SuffixTree.Persistent`, `SuffixTree.Mcp.Core`). Each cycle opens by
**freezing a contract** — an explicit, written list of the behaviours, formats, and public
surfaces that the refactor must NOT change — and then reshapes internal architecture behind
that frozen contract, proving each phase behaviour-preserving with **mandatory test gates**.
This is [[characterization-testing]] applied at campaign scale: the freeze is the pinned
"as-is", the gates are the invariance check. This page is the **shared campaign record**;
the individual cycle plans, freeze docs, and verification reports reconcile onto it. The
methodology below originates in the campaign **plan**
(`suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-plan.md`), which sets the no-regression goal, the
ordered phase roadmap, and the merge/rollback rules the freeze and verification docs execute.

## The originating plan (goal, phase roadmap, merge rules)

The campaign's founding document is the **plan**
(`suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-plan.md`) — the methodology the per-cycle freeze and
verification docs execute. It fixes three things the cycle docs then carry out.

**The goal — a no-regression refactor along three axes.** Reshape the suffix-tree modules
(`SuffixTree`, `SuffixTree.Persistent`, `SuffixTree.Mcp.Core`) **without regressions in
(1) correctness, (2) performance profile, or (3) storage-format behaviour**. These three
axes are exactly why the gates below split into a mandatory behavioural set plus targeted
parity/performance categories — each axis gets its own guard.

**The ordered phase roadmap.** The plan lays out **eight sequential phases**, each a small,
bounded piece of architecture work behind the frozen contract:

1. **Baseline and guardrail artifacts** — establish the gates before touching code.
2. **Decompose persistent load** — extract header read/validation out of the loader.
3. **Normalize the text-matching contract** — remove concrete-type checks so matching binds
   to the interface, not a backend type.
4. **Split mapped-storage responsibilities** into dedicated partials/helpers.
5. **De-recursify the in-memory diagnostics traversal** (eliminate recursion in the
   diagnostics walk).
6. **Split the MCP tools by bounded context** while preserving external API behaviour.
7. **Align target-framework and nullable policy** across the suffix-tree modules and tests.
8. **Final cleanup and invariant verification.**

The per-cycle commit traces recorded elsewhere on this page (Cycle 2's eight-phase trace,
Cycle 3's nine-phase trace) are the *executions* of this roadmap — the plan is the template
each cycle instantiates and adapts.

**The merge/rollback rules — the discipline that makes the gates enforceable.** Four rules
govern how phases land:

1. **Keep each phase small and reviewable.**
2. **Commit only changes related to the current phase** (no unrelated edits in a phase
   commit — so any gate failure bisects to one step).
3. **Do not merge phase N+1 until phase N's gates are green** — a hard stop-the-line rule;
   a red gate blocks progression rather than being carried forward.
4. **Preserve binary format v6 compatibility and the parity contracts** as a standing
   constraint across every phase, not just format-touching ones.

Rule 3 is the campaign's rollback discipline: because each phase is an isolated, gated
commit, a regression is contained to and reverted from a single reviewable step instead of
unwinding a large merged change.

## The contract-freeze method

Before touching code in a cycle, write down what stays fixed. The **Cycle 3** freeze
(`suffix-tree-contract-freeze-cycle3.md`, 2026-02-25) locks five classes of invariant:

1. **Persistent binary format** stays **v6-compatible** — `MAGIC`, header layout, the hybrid
   compact/large zones, and jump-table semantics (see the v6 header in [[suffix-tree]]).
2. **`ISuffixTree` public contract** stays stable for `Contains`, `FindAllOccurrences`,
   `CountOccurrences`, `LongestRepeatedSubstring`, `LongestCommonSubstring`, `Traverse`, and
   `FindExactMatchAnchors`.
3. **Empty-pattern behaviour** stays stable: `Contains("") == true`,
   `CountOccurrences("") == Text.Length`, and `FindAllOccurrences("")` returns every valid
   start index.
4. **Traversal branch-balance** stays stable: every `EnterBranch` has a matching `ExitBranch`
   (the invariant the serializer's structural-hash visitor depends on).
5. **MCP suffix-tree tool names** stay stable: `suffix_tree_contains`, `suffix_tree_count`,
   `suffix_tree_find_all`, `suffix_tree_lrs`, `suffix_tree_lcs`, `suffix_tree_stats`.

The frozen surface is deliberately the *externally observable* one — file format, public
interface, empty-input edge cases, and the tool names other systems bind to. Everything
below it is fair game for the cycle.

## What Cycle 3 was allowed to change

With the contract frozen, Cycle 3's architecture focus was internal-only:

1. Reduce `PersistentSuffixTreeBuilder` coupling by **extracting explicit state** and passing
   components in.
2. **De-duplicate** streaming traversal logic into shared algorithms.
3. Improve lifecycle ergonomics for the persistent factory APIs.
4. Keep the MCP external contracts stable while **clarifying bounded contexts** internally.

None of these touch a frozen invariant — they refactor the persistent builder and shared
traversal code while leaving format, interface, empty-pattern semantics, branch-balance, and
tool names byte-for-byte identical.

## The base contract-freeze doc and its `MaxDepth` divergence

The original freeze (`suffix-tree-contract-freeze.md`, dated 2026-02-25, self-titled
"Contract Freeze (Cycle 2)") locks the **same five invariant classes** as the Cycle 3 freeze
above — v6 binary format, the `ISuffixTree` public contract, empty-pattern behaviour,
traversal branch-balance, and the six `suffix_tree_*` MCP tool names — and enforces the same
per-phase gates. What it adds that Cycle 3 does not is an explicit **"known contract
divergence to resolve in this cycle"**: a documented spot where the frozen contract is *not
yet* internally consistent, made a first-class work item rather than an accident to trip over
mid-refactor.

- **The divergence:** `MaxDepth` semantics **differ between the in-memory and persistent
  implementations** — the two backends behind the one `ISuffixTree` do not agree on what
  `MaxDepth` means.
- **The cycle target:** **unify `MaxDepth` under a single `ISuffixTree` contract** while
  **keeping the parity tests green** (the persistent `Category=Parity` in-memory-vs-persistent
  equivalence gate below is exactly what proves the unification did not break either backend).

This is the freeze method used in its harder mode: freezing a contract does not require the
contract to already be self-consistent — a known divergence is written down alongside the
frozen surface and scheduled for reconciliation within the cycle, under the same gates.

## Cycle 2 verification outcome

The **Cycle 2 verification report**
(`suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-cycle2-verification.md`) is the closing record for the
cycle the base freeze opened — it shows the frozen contract held and the scheduled `MaxDepth`
divergence was resolved under the gates.

- **All mandatory gates green (final run):** the three SuffixTree test projects passed in
  full — `SuffixTree.Tests` **353/353**, `SuffixTree.Persistent.Tests` **499/499**,
  `SuffixTree.Mcp.Core.Tests` **62/62** (all `-c Release`). No frozen invariant regressed.
- **The `MaxDepth` divergence was resolved in-cycle:** phase 3,
  `5eefd67 fix(contract): align persistent max-depth semantics`, unifies the in-memory-vs-
  persistent `MaxDepth` disagreement flagged by the base freeze — exactly the work item the
  freeze scheduled — with the persistent parity tests kept green as proof neither backend
  broke.
- **Eight-phase commit trace, one commit per phase.** After freezing the invariants
  (`c25422e`) and adding **cross-implementation contract guards** (`64c1535`), the cycle
  resolved `MaxDepth` (`5eefd67`) and then did structural-only architecture work: split the
  persistent tree into **partials** (`6fe102d`), and decomposed `PersistentSuffixTreeBuilder`
  in four steps — extract build state + finalize pipeline (`5550be3`), split sequential
  finalize (`6f74b2d`), decompose finalize-pipeline methods (`f219acc`), and isolate pass-1
  node processing (`4535fb5`). Every phase was decomposition/extraction, with parity protected
  by the contract guards and the mandatory test gates run after each phase.
- **One environment-level flake, not a code regression:**
  `ComplexityGuardTests.Build_RepetitiveInput_StillLinear` showed timing variance on some
  first runs and passed on immediate rerun with no code change — a note about the performance
  gate's sensitivity, not a broken invariant.

## Cycle 3 verification outcome

The **Cycle 3 verification report**
(`suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-cycle3-verification.md`, 2026-02-25) is the closing
record for the cycle the Cycle 3 freeze opened — it confirms the frozen contract held across
the internal-only architecture work described above.

- **All mandatory gates green (final run):** the three SuffixTree test projects passed in
  full — `SuffixTree.Tests` **353/353**, `SuffixTree.Persistent.Tests` **503/503**,
  `SuffixTree.Mcp.Core.Tests` **62/62** (all `-c Release`). The persistent count is **up from
  Cycle 2's 499/499** (four added tests), and no frozen invariant regressed.
- **Both targeted gates green with concrete counts:** `Category=Parity` in the persistent
  tests (in-memory vs persistent equivalence) passed **112/112** and `Category=Performance` in
  the in-memory tests passed **12/12** — Cycle 3 is the first verification to record explicit
  parity/perf counts, proving the persistent-builder and traversal refactors kept the two
  backends behaviourally identical and within the complexity guards.
- **Nine-phase commit trace, one commit per phase**, realizing the "what Cycle 3 was allowed
  to change" plan: freeze invariants (`b5fa00e`) → stabilize the complexity/perf guards
  (`e4bfbb9`) → then structural-only refactors — extract explicit runtime state containers
  (`2f32767`), split the sequential finalize-pass orchestration (`b61a192`), introduce child
  and depth **storage adapters** (`aa66e3a`) in `PersistentSuffixTreeBuilder`; unify the null
  and empty-pattern contracts in search (`08cad7d`); de-duplicate streaming traversal steps
  (`9d85e3f`); add ergonomic persistent-lifecycle factory APIs (`838f05d`); and isolate the
  MCP genomics tool handlers (`780604a`). Every phase was decomposition/extraction, gated per
  phase.
- **One environment-level flake, not a code regression:** during an intermediate finalization
  run `Build_ScalesLinearly` transiently failed on timing variance and passed on immediate
  rerun with no code change — a different perf-guard test than Cycle 2's
  `Build_RepetitiveInput_StillLinear`, but the same class of environment-sensitivity note
  rather than a broken invariant.

## Guardrails (per-phase gates)

The freeze is only enforceable if every phase is checked against it. Cycle 3's guardrails:

- **Mandatory gates after each phase** — the three SuffixTree test projects must pass:
  `tests/SuffixTree/SuffixTree.Tests`, `tests/SuffixTree/SuffixTree.Persistent.Tests`,
  `tests/SuffixTree/SuffixTree.Mcp.Core.Tests`.
- **Format/perf-sensitive phases** additionally run the targeted categories:
  `Category=Parity` in the persistent tests (in-memory vs persistent equivalence) and
  `Category=Performance` in the in-memory tests.
- **One commit per phase; no unrelated changes** in a phase commit — so any regression the
  gates catch bisects to a single, reviewable step.

This mirrors the [[build-quality-gate]] philosophy (a gate that must be green to proceed) but
scoped to behavioural equivalence rather than static analysis.

## Why this matters

The suffix-tree engine has two backends behind one interface and a persistent on-disk format
that other artifacts already depend on ([[suffix-tree]]). A naive refactor risks silently
changing the binary format, an empty-input edge case, or an MCP tool name — breakage that
unit correctness tests would not necessarily surface. Freezing the contract turns those
risks into explicit, testable assertions and makes each cycle's diff safe to bisect.

## Campaign cluster

This concept is the reconciliation target for the six suffix-tree controlled-refactoring
documents under `docs/refactoring/`:

- `suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-plan.md` — the overall plan (ingested here; the
  originating methodology — no-regression goal across correctness/performance/storage-format,
  the eight-phase roadmap, and the small-phase / one-commit / gate-before-merge / preserve-v6
  rules).
- `suffix-tree-contract-freeze.md` — the initial contract freeze (ingested here; adds the
  `MaxDepth` divergence work item).
- `suffix-tree-contract-freeze-cycle3.md` — the Cycle 3 freeze (ingested here).
- `suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-verification.md` — the remaining per-cycle
  verification report (not yet ingested).
- `suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-cycle3-verification.md` — the Cycle 3 verification
  report (ingested here; records the all-green gate run with explicit parity **112/112** /
  performance **12/12** counts, persistent **503/503**, and the nine-phase trace).
- `suffix-tree-controlled-refactoring-cycle2-verification.md` — the Cycle 2 verification
  report (ingested here; records the all-green gate run and the `MaxDepth` resolution).

As the remaining one is ingested, add it to this page's `sources:`, bump `source_commit`
to HEAD, and enrich only genuinely distinct content (plan rationale, earlier frozen
contracts, and the verification outcomes per cycle).

# K-mer statistics (composition summary + Shannon k-entropy over the count profile)

The **K-mer** family's *summary-statistics* operation: `KmerAnalyzer.AnalyzeKmers` reduces a
sequence's k-mer count profile to a small `KmerStatistics` bundle — `TotalKmers`, `UniqueKmers`,
`MaxCount`, `MinCount`, `AverageCount`, and `Entropy` (Shannon **k-entropy** in bits). It is a
**companion summary layer**, not a new counting algorithm: it calls the same `CountKmers`
sliding-window primitive the rest of the family shares and aggregates the resulting multiset. Its one
genuinely distinct piece of content is the **k-entropy** — the Shannon entropy of the k-mer frequency
distribution, a diversity/complexity measure with its own literature. Validated under test unit
**KMER-STATS-001** (record [[kmer-stats-001-evidence]]); [[test-unit-registry]] tracks the unit and
[[algorithm-validation-evidence]] describes the evidence-artifact pattern.

## Core model

For a sequence `S` of length `L` and window length `k` (`1 ≤ k ≤ L`), the k-mers are the multiset of
the `L − k + 1` overlapping length-`k` windows. Let `mult(α)` be the multiplicity of k-mer `α` and
`D` the number of **distinct** k-mers. `AnalyzeKmers` computes:

| Field | Definition | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| `TotalKmers` | `L − k + 1` = `Σ mult(α)` | number of overlapping windows (Wikipedia) |
| `UniqueKmers` | `D` = distinct k-mer count | **the distinct count**, *not* singletons — see the gotcha below |
| `MaxCount` | `max_α mult(α)` | most-frequent k-mer's multiplicity |
| `MinCount` | `min_α mult(α)` | least-frequent k-mer's multiplicity |
| `AverageCount` | `TotalKmers / D` = `(L − k + 1)/D` | average multiplicity; **rounded to 2 dp** in the output |
| `Entropy` | `−Σ p(α) log₂ p(α)`, `p(α) = mult(α)/(L − k + 1)` | Shannon **k-entropy**, bits, unrounded |

The **k-entropy** is the one formula unique to this unit: `E_k = −Σ p(α) log₂ p(α)` over the relative
frequencies of the k-mers (Manca et al. 2021, *Spectral concepts in genome informational analysis*;
corroborated by the Entropy–Rank Ratio preprint, arXiv:2511.05300), base-2 (bits), convention
`0·log 0 = 0`. It measures the diversity/evenness of the k-mer composition: minimal (0) for a single
distinct k-mer, maximal (`log₂(L−k+1)`) when every window is distinct.

## Gotcha: `UniqueKmers` is the *distinct* count, not the singleton count

Despite the name, the `UniqueKmers` field holds `D` = the number of **distinct** k-mers (each different
k-mer counted once), **not** the number of k-mers that occur exactly once. The "unique" (count == 1)
singleton notion is a **separate** unit, KMER-UNIQUE-001 — synthesized in
[[unique-and-mincount-kmers]] (`KmerAnalyzer.FindUniqueKmers`). For `ATCGATCAC` k=3 the distinct count
is 6 (`UniqueKmers = 6`) while the singleton count is 5.

## Properties and invariants

| ID | Invariant | Holds because |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| INV-01 | `TotalKmers == Σ_α mult(α) == L − k + 1` (for `1 ≤ k ≤ L`) | one k-mer per start position |
| INV-02 | `UniqueKmers == D`, the distinct count from `CountKmers` | direct definition; cross-checked independently |
| INV-03 | `MinCount ≤ AverageCount·(rounding) ≤ MaxCount`, and `MaxCount == MinCount` ⇔ every distinct k-mer equally frequent | extremes bound the mean of the multiplicity distribution |
| INV-04 | single distinct k-mer (homopolymer) ⇒ `Entropy = 0`, `MaxCount == MinCount == TotalKmers` | one-component distribution `p = 1`, `−1·log₂1 = 0` |
| INV-05 | all k-mers distinct ⇒ `Entropy = log₂ D`, `MaxCount == MinCount == 1` | uniform distribution `p = 1/D` over `D` equiprobable k-mers |
| INV-06 | `k > L` or empty `S` ⇒ all-zero `KmerStatistics` | `L − k + 1 ≤ 0` ⇒ no k-mers |

## Contract and edge cases

- **Inputs:** `sequence` (string; empty/null → all-zero statistics; upper-cased internally so the
  statistics are **case-insensitive**), `k` (`int`, `> 0`; `k > L` → all-zero result). `k ≤ 0` →
  `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (shared with the sibling counting methods).
- **Output:** a `KmerStatistics` value with the six fields above; `AverageCount` rounded to 2 decimals,
  `Entropy` unrounded in bits.
- **Edge cases:** empty / `k > L` → all fields 0; homopolymer → entropy 0 (INV-04); all-distinct →
  entropy `log₂ D` (INV-05); lower/mixed case → same statistics as upper.

## Worked oracles

- `GTAGAGCTGT` (L=10) **k=1** → Total 10, Unique 4, Max 4 (G), Min 1 (C), Average 2.5, Entropy
  1.846439344671… bits.
- `GTAGAGCTGT` **k=2** → 9 / 7 / 2 / 1, Average 9/7 ≈ 1.29 (rounded). **k=3** → 8 / 8 / 1 / 1, Entropy
  `log₂8 = 3.0` (8 equiprobable k-mers, INV-05).
- `ATCGATCAC` (L=9) k=3 → Total 7, Unique 6, Max 2 (ATC), Min 1, Average 7/6 ≈ 1.17, Entropy
  2.521640636343… bits.
- `AAAA` (L=4) k=2 → Total 3, Unique 1, Max=Min=3, Average 3.0, Entropy 0 (homopolymer, INV-04).

## Deviations and assumptions

- **No source contradictions; deviations = None.** The Wikipedia/BioInfoLogics count tables and the
  Manca / Entropy–Rank Ratio k-entropy formula are implemented verbatim.
- **ASSUMPTION (presentation-only):** `AverageCount` is rounded to 2 decimals (`Math.Round(_, 2)`) —
  the underlying `total/distinct` ratio is exact; `Entropy` is returned unrounded in bits (log base 2).
  Neither affects correctness; tests assert the rounded average and entropy within `1e-10`.

## Second entry point: the same k-entropy as the `SEQ-COMPLEX-*` complexity member (SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001)

The k-entropy above has a **second, standalone implementation** validated as test unit
**SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001** — `SequenceComplexity.CalculateKmerEntropy(sequence, k = 2)`, the
**entropy member of the sequence complexity/entropy family** (siblings
[[sequence-complexity-compression-lempel-ziv]] LZ76 and [[dust-low-complexity-score]] DUST). It
computes the **identical formula** — `H = −Σ (nᵢ/N) log₂(nᵢ/N)`, `N = L − k + 1`, bits — over the
same overlapping k-mer multiset; it is *not a different measure*, just the complexity-family entry
point (a sibling of `CalculateLinguisticComplexity` / `EstimateCompressionRatio` / `CalculateDustScore`
in the `SequenceComplexity` class) rather than a field of the `KmerStatistics` bundle. Low-complexity
⇒ skewed distribution ⇒ **low** H; high-complexity (uniform) ⇒ **high** H. The source trace and worked
oracles are in [[seq-complex-kmer-001-evidence]]; [[test-unit-registry]] tracks the unit.

Worked oracles (bits): `ACGT` k=1 → `log₂4 = 2.0`; `ACGT` k=2 → `log₂3 ≈ 1.5849625` (all-distinct);
`ATATAT` k=2 → `0.9709505945` (binary entropy of p=0.6; dimers AT×3, TA×2 over N=5); `AAAA` k=2 →
`0.0` (homopolymer); `AAACGT` k=2 → `1.9219280949` (= log₂5 − 0.4). Contract mirrors the siblings:
`L < k → 0`; `k < 1` → `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`; null `DnaSequence` → `ArgumentNullException`;
null/empty string → 0; string and `DnaSequence` overloads agree (case-insensitive). Bounds:
`0 ≤ H ≤ log₂(L−k+1)` (Shannon). This matches INV-04/INV-05 of the `AnalyzeKmers` version above. The
default window is `k = 2` (di-nucleotide structure). The alphabet of outcomes is **unconstrained** —
every distinct length-`k` substring is a symbol, with **no IUPAC filtering**, so any character
(including `N`) participates.

### Implementation surface and design notes (SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001 spec)

The primary algorithm spec `docs/algorithms/Complexity/K-mer_Entropy.md` adds the implementation
detail behind this entry point (all in `SequenceComplexity.cs`): the public
`CalculateKmerEntropy(DnaSequence, int)` / `(string, int)` overloads validate and upper-case, then
delegate to a private `CalculateKmerEntropyCore(string, int)` that enumerates the overlapping k-mers
in a **single linear scan** with a `Dictionary<string,int>` of counts and applies
`H = −Σ p_i log₂ p_i` over the dictionary values. **Complexity: O(N·k) time, O(D·k) space**
(N = L − k + 1 windows, each substring build/hash O(k); D = distinct k-mers stored). The repository
suffix tree was **evaluated and deliberately not used** — this is one linear pass building a full
frequency table (every position visited once), not a repeated occurrence-query workload, so a suffix
tree would add construction overhead without lowering the linear cost (the same reuse-policy note the
sibling [[dust-low-complexity-score]] records).

**vs. per-base Shannon entropy (`CalculateShannonEntropy`).** K-mer entropy generalizes the family's
character-level per-base Shannon entropy ([[shannon-entropy]]): the per-base version is effectively `k = 1` over just the
4 nucleotides (max `log₂4 = 2` bits, composition-only, blind to order), whereas k-mer entropy with
`k ≥ 2` captures di-/tri-nucleotide **local order** and saturates at `log₂(L − k + 1)`.

**Not implemented (spec-flagged).** Only the **raw bits** value is returned — the **normalised**
entropy `H / log₂ N` and the *entropy–rank ratio* of Çakır et al. (arXiv:2511.05300) are **not**
computed; normalise externally if you need it. Because the metric is un-normalised, values from
sequences of **different lengths are not directly comparable**, and it models k-mer frequency only —
**not** positional structure or reverse-complement equivalence. Cited basis: Li 2025 *longdust*

## Relation to other units

- **Summary layer over the shared count.** `AnalyzeKmers` aggregates the same synchronous
  `KmerAnalyzer.CountKmers` sliding-window multiset that underlies [[asynchronous-kmer-counting]] and
  [[both-strand-kmer-counting]] (a future sync-count concept will own the `L − k + 1` count
  definition, and this page will link to it) — it computes *statistics over* the profile rather than
  producing it.
- Distinct from the family's other operations: [[k-mer-generation]] enumerates the full `n^k`
  **universe** (sequence-independent), [[k-mer-positions]] indexes **where** one k-mer occurs, and
  [[k-mer-euclidean-distance]] / [[kmer-jaccard-similarity]] compare the frequency/presence profiles of
  **two** sequences — whereas this unit summarizes the profile of **one**.
- The **k-entropy** here is the k-mer specialization of Shannon sequence entropy; a general
  [[shannon-entropy]] unit relates to it as the character-level counterpart.
  It is the **entropy member of the `SEQ-COMPLEX-*` complexity family** (validated standalone as
  SEQ-COMPLEX-KMER-001, above). Its family siblings are **distinct scalar measures** over the same
  sequence: the compression-based [[sequence-complexity-compression-lempel-ziv]] (Lempel–Ziv LZ76
  count) counts adaptively discovered **variable-length** phrases along the whole sequence rather
  than a fixed-`k` frequency distribution, so it captures ordered pattern buildup that a fixed-`k`
  k-entropy misses; the [[dust-low-complexity-score]] DUST masker sums `∑ c(c−1)/2` over a fixed
  `k = 3` triplet count profile (a *high* score ⇒ low complexity, the opposite numeric direction to
  entropy). All three are low exactly where low-complexity/repeat tracts are.

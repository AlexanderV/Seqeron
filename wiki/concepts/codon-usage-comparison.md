# Codon usage table and TVD comparison

The **raw** end of the codon-usage family (`CodonOptimizer.CalculateCodonUsage` +
`CompareCodonUsage`, test unit [[codon-usage-001-evidence|CODON-USAGE-001]]): produce an
unnormalized codon-count table, and compare two such tables with a distribution-distance
similarity. Distinct from the codon-usage-*bias* measures — it does no per-amino-acid
normalization and computes no single per-gene score. See [[test-unit-registry]] for tracking.

## The raw usage table

`CalculateCodonUsage(sequence)` splits a coding sequence into non-overlapping triplets from
offset 0, counts each codon, and returns `Dictionary<string, int>` of **raw counts**:

    Count(c) = |{ i : sequence[i : i+3] = c }|

It converts `T → U` internally (RNA representation), uppercases, and drops an incomplete trailing
codon. This is the same counting primitive behind [[relative-synonymous-codon-usage|RSCU]]'s
`CountCodons`, but **left unnormalized** — hence the raw base of the family rather than a bias
measure. Invariant: Σ counts = total codons.

**Normalized, frame-aware sibling:** `SequenceStatistics.CalculateCodonFrequencies(sequence, frame)`
([[seq-codon-freq-001-evidence|SEQ-CODON-FREQ-001]], Analysis assembly) is the frequency analog of
this table — it returns `count / total` fractions directly (`double`, not `int` counts), keeps DNA
codons (no `T→U` rewrite), **excludes non-ACGT/ambiguous triplets** (Kazusa CUTG convention), and
adds a **reading-frame offset** (0/1/2) so the same sequence yields a different codon multiset per
frame. Use the raw-count table here when you need integer counts or the TVD comparison; use the
frequency method when you want normalized fractions or a non-zero frame.

## TVD-based comparison

`CompareCodonUsage(seq1, seq2)` normalizes both count tables to frequency distributions
(`f(c) = count(c) / total`) and returns a **Total Variation Distance (TVD) similarity** in
`[0, 1]`:

    Similarity = 1 − ( Σ_c |f₁(c) − f₂(c)| ) / 2

The `Σ|f₁−f₂|` is the L¹ distance between the two frequency vectors; halving it gives the TVD of
the two probability distributions, and `1 − TVD` turns distance into similarity.

**Proven properties** (from TVD theory, and used as differential-test oracles):

- **Identity** — `sim(s, s) = 1.0` (zero distance for identical distributions).
- **Symmetry** — `sim(a, b) = sim(b, a)` (since `|x−y| = |y−x|`).
- **Range** — `sim ∈ [0, 1]` (TVD of probability distributions ∈ [0, 1]).
- **Disjoint → 0** — non-overlapping codon sets give `Σ|f₁−f₂| = 1 + 1 = 2`, so `sim = 0`.
- **Partial overlap** — exact value derivable for any input (e.g. 2/3 shared codons → `sim = 2/3`).

**Edge behaviour:** empty input → similarity `0` (convention: no data → 0), not NaN or an
exception; `T`/`U` treated as equivalent; incomplete trailing codons ignored.

## Why TVD (a deliberate metric choice)

Wikipedia's codon-usage-bias article lists cosine similarity and correlation coefficients among
codon-table comparison metrics; this unit uses TVD-based similarity instead. Every expected test
value is analytically derivable from the TVD formula, and the four proven properties above follow
directly from TVD theory — so the choice is defensible and fully oracle-backed rather than a
departure from a fixed reference. The predefined organism tables (E. coli K12, S. cerevisiae,
H. sapiens) were verified against the **Kazusa Codon Usage Database** (all 64 relative fractions
match to 2 dp).

## Relation to other codon-usage statistics

This is the unnormalized base of the family. **[[relative-synonymous-codon-usage|RSCU]]** normalizes
the same codon counts per synonymous family; **[[codon-adaptation-index|CAI]]** reduces them to a
single geometric-mean gene score; **[[effective-number-of-codons|ENC/Nc]]** measures reference-free
bias via codon homozygosity; **[[rare-codon-analysis]]** thresholds per-family frequencies; and
**[[codon-optimization]]** consumes a usage table to rewrite a CDS. The aggregation/reporting view
is [[codon-stats-001-evidence|CODON-STATS-001]] (`GetStatistics`). What is unique here is the
**distribution-comparison** operation (`CompareCodonUsage`): a TVD similarity between two whole
codon-frequency distributions, which none of the bias measures provide.

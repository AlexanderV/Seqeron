# <Algorithm Name>

## Documented Theory

<!-- All content in this section comes from authoritative sources only. -->
<!-- Do not describe implementation behavior here. -->

### Purpose

<definition with source citations>

### Core Mechanism

<!-- Formal description: recurrences, formulas, scoring model, etc. -->

### Properties

<!-- Determinism, optimality guarantees, correctness proofs if applicable. -->

### Complexity

| Aspect | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Time | | |
| Space | | |

## Implementation Notes

<!-- This section describes the actual code in the repository. -->

**Implementation location:** [<ClassName.cs>](<relative path from repo root>)

- `<MethodName>`: <description>

<!-- One bullet per public/internal method relevant to this algorithm. -->

---

## Deviations and Assumptions

<!-- Per Implementation conformance policy: deviations are defects, not documentation items. -->
<!-- Every item here MUST have a resolution status. -->

<!-- Status values: -->
<!-- 🔧 FIXED — deviation was corrected in this Test Unit processing -->
<!-- ⛔ BLOCKED — cannot resolve, Test Unit blocked -->
<!-- ⚠ ASSUMPTION — no authoritative source exists; assumption documented and tested separately -->

| # | Item | Type | Status | Resolution |
|---|------|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **<Name>** | Deviation / Assumption | 🔧/⛔/⚠ | <what was done> |

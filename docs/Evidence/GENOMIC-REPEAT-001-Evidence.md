**URL:** https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451-f17/lectures/lec10-sufftree.pdf
**Accessed:** 2026-06-13
**Authority rank:** 1 (peer-instruction university course notes, textbook-level)
**Retrieval:** WebSearch "longest repeated substring suffix tree deepest internal node algorithm Gusfield" → fetched the PDF URL; WebFetch returned only binary, so the saved PDF was converted with `pdftotext` and grepped.

**Key Extracted Points:**

1. **Longest-repeat definition + algorithm (verbatim, §2.1):** "Find the longest repeat in T . That is, find the longest string r such [that] r occurs at least twice in T : Find the deepest node that has ≥ 2 leaves under it." (lines 199–200 of the extracted text). "Deepest" is in the sense of the longest string spelled from the root.
2. **Suffix-tree node structure:** "each internal node now has degree at least 2, hence the total number of nodes in the tree is at most twice the number of leaves" and "each leaf corresponds to some suffix of T". This is why a substring that occurs ≥ 2 times corresponds to an internal node (≥ 2 leaves below), and a substring occurring once corresponds to a leaf.
3. **Linear construction:** The suffix tree representation "uses O(t) space" for text length t; the longest-repeat query is a single traversal, so the overall solution is linear.

### Wikipedia — Longest repeated substring problem

**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_repeated_substring_problem
**Accessed:** 2026-06-13
**Authority rank:** 4 (encyclopedic; used for the worked example and to corroborate CMU)
**Retrieval:** WebSearch (same query as above) → WebFetch of the article URL.

**Key Extracted Points:**

1. **Problem statement:** "The problem of finding the longest substring of a string that occurs at least twice."
2. **Algorithm:** Build a suffix tree with an end-of-string marker (e.g. `$`) and find "the deepest internal node in the tree with more than one child"; the path from root to that node spells a longest repeated substring. Depth = number of characters traversed from the root.
3. **Complexity:** Linear time and space, Θ(n).
4. **Worked example (verbatim):** Input `ATCGATCGA$` → longest repeated substring `ATCGA`.

### GeeksforGeeks — Suffix Tree Application 3: Longest Repeated Substring

**URL:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/suffix-tree-application-3-longest-repeated-substring/
**Accessed:** 2026-06-13
**Authority rank:** 3 (reference implementation walk-through; used for additional worked examples)
**Retrieval:** WebSearch "longest repeated substring suffix tree deepest internal node algorithm Gusfield" → WebFetch of the article URL.

**Key Extracted Points:**

1. **Selection rule (verbatim):** "longest repeated substring will end at the internal node which is farthest from the root (i.e. deepest node in the tree), because length of substring is the path label length from root to that internal node." A repeated substring's path "terminates at an internal node (a node with multiple children), not a leaf."
2. **Worked examples (input → LRS):**
   - `GEEKSFORGEEKS` → `GEEKS`
   - `AAAAAAAAAA` → `AAAAAAAAA`
   - `ABCDEFG` → No repeated substring
   - `ABABABA` → `ABABA`
   - `banana` → `ana`
3. **Complexity:** Building the suffix tree (Ukkonen) is O(N); finding the deepest node is O(N); overall linear.

**URL:** https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~langmea/resources/lecture_notes/08_suffix_trees_v2.pdf
**Accessed:** 2026-06-13
**Authority rank:** 1 (university bioinformatics course notes, explicitly tracking Gusfield)
**Retrieval:** WebSearch "maximal repeat suffix tree bioinformatics definition Gusfield algorithms on strings" → fetched PDF, converted with `pdftotext` and grepped.

**Key Extracted Points:**

1. **Gusfield grounding:** The notes' suffix-tree applications cite "Gusfield 5.4" (Gusfield, *Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences*, ch. 5–7) as the source for the suffix-tree application family that includes repeat finding.
2. **Internal-node ⇒ shared substring:** The notes use the same characterization for the related longest-common-substring application — every internal node's path label is a substring that recurs; leaves are unique-position suffixes — confirming the "internal node ⇔ repeated substring" mapping used by the LRS algorithm.
3. **Maximal repeats (search-result summary, corroborated by the notes' references to REPuter/Kurtz):** A maximal repeat's path label is an internal node, and there are at most n maximal repeats in a string of length n.

## Documented Corner Cases and Failure Modes

### From CMU 15-451 §2.1 and GeeksforGeeks

1. **No repeat exists:** When every substring occurs at most once (no internal node has ≥ 2 leaves), there is no longest repeated substring. GeeksforGeeks: `ABCDEFG` → "No repeated substring". Expected output for this implementation: `RepeatInfo.None` (empty sequence).
2. **Overlapping repeats are allowed:** The definition counts occurrences regardless of overlap. GeeksforGeeks `AAAAAAAAAA` (length 10) → `AAAAAAAAA` (length 9), whose two occurrences at positions 0 and 1 overlap; and `ABABABA` → `ABABA` (occurrences at 0 and 2 overlap). The suffix-tree definition (≥ 2 leaves under a node) does not require non-overlapping occurrences.
3. **Ties:** When several substrings share the maximum length, the problem statement asks for *a* longest repeated substring; any one of equal length is correct (Wikipedia: "a longest repeated substring").

## Test Datasets

### Dataset: Wikipedia LRS example

**Source:** Wikipedia, Longest repeated substring problem (accessed 2026-06-13).

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Input | `ATCGATCGA` (Wikipedia appends terminal `$`; the repo builds the tree with its own terminal internally) |
| Longest repeated substring | `ATCGA` |
| Length | 5 |
| Occurrence count | 2 |
| Occurrence start positions (0-based) | 0, 4 |

### Dataset: GeeksforGeeks worked examples (DNA-alphabet-compatible subset and analogs)

**Source:** GeeksforGeeks, Suffix Tree Application 3 (accessed 2026-06-13).

| Input (as published) | DNA analog used in tests | LRS | Length | Count | Positions |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----|--------|-------|-----------|
| `AAAAAAAAAA` | `AAAAAAAAAA` (valid DNA) | `AAAAAAAAA` | 9 | 2 | 0, 1 |
| `ABCDEFG` (no repeat) | `ACGT` (no repeat) | (none) | 0 | 0 | — |
| `ABABABA` | `ATATATA` | `ATATA` | 5 | 2 | 0, 2 |

> Rationale for DNA analogs: `GenomicAnalyzer.FindLongestRepeat` takes a `DnaSequence`, whose alphabet is restricted to A/C/G/T (`DnaSequence.ValidateSequence`). The non-DNA GeeksforGeeks strings (`GEEKSFORGEEKS`, `banana`, `ABCDEFG`, `ABABABA`) are mapped to A/C/G/T strings with the identical repeat structure; the structural property (deepest internal node) is alphabet-independent, so the expected LRS, length, count, and overlap pattern are preserved.

### Dataset: FindRepeats enumeration (all repeated substrings ≥ minLength)

**Source:** Definition (CMU §2.1 generalized to all internal nodes ≥ minLength) + repository semantics verified against the suffix tree. Every substring that occurs ≥ 2 times in `ACGTACGTTTTTACGT` and has length ≥ 3.

| minLength | Repeated substrings (occurrences ≥ 2), with positions |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 | `ACGT` @ {0,4,12}; `CGT` @ {1,5,13}; `TACGT` @ {3,11}; `TTT` @ {7,8,9}; `TTTT` @ {7,8} |

## Assumptions

1. **ASSUMPTION: Tie-breaking among equal-length longest repeats** — When more than one substring shares the maximum repeated length, the authoritative sources require only "a longest repeated substring" (Wikipedia), not a specific one. The repository returns whichever the suffix tree's deepest-internal-node bookkeeping records. Tests therefore avoid asserting a unique winner where the worked example has multiple equal-length maximal repeats; all cited test inputs have a single longest repeat, so this assumption is not exercised by any MUST case.
2. **ASSUMPTION: Occurrence ordering** — `RepeatInfo.Positions` is sorted ascending by 0-based start index. This is an output-shape convention (the implementation calls `OrderBy(p => p)`); the *set* of positions is fixed by the definition, only their listing order is conventional.

## Recommendations for Test Coverage

1. **MUST Test:** `FindLongestRepeat("ATCGATCGA")` returns sequence `ATCGA`, length 5, count 2, positions {0,4}. — Evidence: Wikipedia worked example.
2. **MUST Test:** `FindLongestRepeat("AAAAAAAAAA")` returns `AAAAAAAAA` (overlapping, length 9, count 2, positions {0,1}). — Evidence: GeeksforGeeks.
3. **MUST Test:** `FindLongestRepeat("ATATATA")` returns `ATATA` (overlapping, length 5, positions {0,2}). — Evidence: GeeksforGeeks `ABABABA`→`ABABA` analog.
4. **MUST Test:** `FindLongestRepeat("ACGT")` (no repeat) returns `RepeatInfo.None`/IsEmpty. — Evidence: GeeksforGeeks `ABCDEFG`→no repeat.
5. **MUST Test:** `FindLongestRepeat("")` (empty) returns `RepeatInfo.None`. — Evidence: definition (no substring occurs twice in the empty string).
6. **MUST Test:** `FindRepeats("ACGTACGTTTTTACGT", 3)` yields exactly {ACGT@{0,4,12}, CGT@{1,5,13}, TACGT@{3,11}, TTT@{7,8,9}, TTTT@{7,8}}; every result has count ≥ 2 and length ≥ minLength. — Evidence: definition; all listed substrings occur ≥ 2 times.
7. **SHOULD Test:** `FindRepeats` returns empty when minLength exceeds any repeat length, and only repeats meeting minLength are returned. — Rationale: minLength filter boundary.
8. **SHOULD Test:** Every `RepeatInfo` from both methods satisfies the invariants (count ≥ 2; length = sequence length; positions sorted; each position is a true occurrence). — Rationale: invariant guard (property test for the O(n²)-or-worse enumeration path).
9. **COULD Test:** `FindRepeats` with minLength ≤ 0 still returns only substrings occurring ≥ 2 times (no zero-length repeats). — Rationale: degenerate parameter.
